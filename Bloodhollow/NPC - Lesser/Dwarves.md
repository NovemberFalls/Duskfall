- **City**: Emberfall
- **Title:** Master Rune-Mender
- **Alignment:** Neutral Good
- **Race:** Dwarf
- **Age:** 182
- **Appearance:**  
    Dain is stocky and broad-shouldered, his beard thick and streaked with white. The runes etched into his armor glow faintly with protective magic. His left arm, replaced with an intricately crafted mechanical limb, hums softly with arcane energy—an invention of his own design.
- **Temperament:**  
    Gruff but deeply empathetic, Dain views his patients as kin, regardless of their race. His bedside manner is unorthodox, but his skill at stitching wounds with magic and steel is unmatched.
- **History:**  
    Dain served as a frontline medic during the **[[0093-09-01 - Emberfall - The Battle Of Ashgate Approach]]**, where he earned his moniker by holding a crumbling trench with nothing but his shield and hammer. After the war, he dedicated himself to healing rather than fighting.
- **Rumors:**  
    Dain’s mechanical arm is rumored to contain a sliver of Veilfire, allowing him to cauterize wounds with a touch. Others claim the arm was a gift from an ancient dwarven ancestor who watches over him still.

- **Race:** Dwarf
- **Age:** 147
- **Appearance:** Varek's beard is braided with tarnished gold and scrap iron, his left eye hidden beneath a rune-etched steel plate. His arms are black with soot up to the elbows, and his thick frame seems more like a smelter’s anvil than flesh and bone.
- **Temperament:** Merciless in the forge, methodical in his craft. Varek tolerates no mistakes and holds grudges like molten iron, cooling slowly but never truly forgotten.
- **History:** Born into Grimhaldir’s forgemaster clans, Varek oversees the shipyards of Emberfall with unrelenting focus. He claims that no warship leaves the docks without part of his soul hammered into the hull.

- **Title:** Overseer of the Molten Spine
- **Alignment:** Lawful Neutral
- **Race:** Dwarf
- **Age:** 189
- **Appearance:** Harlik’s skin bears deep, jagged burn scars, and his left eye has been replaced with a molten shard that flickers when angered. His beard is charred and braided with steel wire, and his hammer is fused to his gauntlet, as if part of his very arm.
- **Temperament:** Gruff but methodical, Harlik tolerates no laziness or wasted steel. He believes weakness in the forge breeds weakness on the battlefield, and he punishes failure with relentless labor.
- **History:** Stonebrand once oversaw Grimhaldir’s forges but abandoned his mountain home after losing his son during the Veilfire War. Now, he rules the Molten Spine, ensuring no weapon leaves Forge Road without tasting fire.

 **Title:** Gauntlet Bouncer (And Fistbreaker)
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral
- **Race:** Dwarf
- **Age:** 79
- **Appearance:** Helka is short, even by dwarven standards, but her stocky frame exudes raw power. Her knuckles are permanently bruised, and her nose has been broken so many times it juts sideways. She wears brass gauntlets engraved with crude runes—each strike humming faintly with magical force.
- **Temperament:** Quick to anger but fiercely loyal to Morvyn. Helka enjoys breaking bones and holds no mercy for drunkards or cheaters. She once broke a man’s spine over a spilled drink, then charged his family for the damage to the floor.
- **History:** Helka was once a blacksmith, but after losing her forge during the Veilfire War, she found comfort in breaking heads instead of shaping steel. Now, she keeps the peace—or breaks it, depending on the crowd.
- **Rumors:** Whispers say Helka’s gauntlets were forged from **the melted armor of fallen knights**, enchanted by a firecaller to grow heavier with each punch. Some claim the gauntlets crave blood and that Helka feeds them willingly.

    Gruff and calculating. Durain believes **no weapon should be forged without purpose.** He speaks little and works often, allowing his craft to speak for him. Though respected by the nobility, he holds no love for political games.
- **History:**  
    Durain rose to prominence after **forging the gate-severing axe that breached the Black Anvil during the revolt of 99 Duskfall.** He has since forged countless relics for Emberfall’s leaders, including **Warden Alric Stoneveil’s halberd** and **Lord Commander Aldric Blackthorn’s crown.**

- **Title:** Overseer of the Iron Vein
- **Alignment:** Neutral
- **Race:** Dwarf
- **Age:** 176

    Irritable but loyal to Thaldrik. Heggrun oversees the more **experimental forges** of the Bloodforge, often clashing with dwarves who fear untested designs. He’s fiercely protective of his workers.

**Warden Elric Stonebrand (Dwarf)**
- **Title:** Warden of the Deep Iron
- **Alignment:** Neutral
- **Race:** Dwarf
- **Age:** 185
- **Appearance:**  
    Elric’s beard is iron-gray, braided tightly to keep away the constant heat below. His left eye is replaced with a **runed obsidian orb** that flickers faintly with blue light. His armor, dark and soot-stained, is engraved with the oaths of his ancestors.
- **Temperament:**  
    Gruff but fair. Elric carries little sympathy for prisoners but harbors disdain for excessive cruelty. He views his role as keeping order, not enforcing Varik’s zeal.
- **History:**  
    A former commander during the **[[0093-09-01 - Emberfall - The Battle Of Ashgate Approach]]**, Elric took the position of Warden after losing his entire unit to orcish Veilfire. He sees his time in the Chainhold as penance for those who died under his watch.
- **Rumors:**  
    Elric is said to speak with spirits trapped in the Deep Iron, and the obsidian orb lets him see them. Whether this grants him insight or torment remains unknown.

**Overseer Drekkan Flintvein**
- **Title:** Master of The Iron Maw
- **Alignment:** Lawful Evil
- **Race:** Dwarf
- **Age:** 162
- **Appearance:** Drekkan’s skin bears deep cracks from years of heat exposure, and his left arm is fitted with a mechanical brace to replace the limb he lost to molten slag. His eyes burn with the faint glow of embers, and his voice carries the weight of a forge bell striking steel.
- **Temperament:** Ruthless, calculating, and indifferent to suffering. Drekkan sees his workers as extensions of the smelter itself—tools to be broken and reforged at will. Mercy has no place in his vocabulary.
- **History:** Once a proud forgemaster of Grimhaldir, Drekkan’s fall came when his forge collapsed, killing dozens. Stripped of his title, he found new purpose in Emberfall, where his cruelty became his strength. Under his iron hand, The Iron Maw churns endlessly, feeding the city’s veins.
- **Rumors:** It is whispered that Drekkan’s mechanical arm is more than just steel—that within its gears, the soul of a rival burns, trapped by dwarven runes and bound to serve him forever.

- **Temperament:** Unforgiving and violent. Grivva rules Smelter’s Row by fear alone, punishing workers and rivals alike with brutal efficiency. She relishes in crushing hope beneath her boots.
- **History:** Once a mere apprentice in the forges, Grivva clawed her way to dominance after killing her former master with her bare hands. She earned her name not from the forge she controls, but for how she **“devours any fool stupid enough to cross her.”**
