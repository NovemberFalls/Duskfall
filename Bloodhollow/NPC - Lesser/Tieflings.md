## Tiefling Lesser Leadership

**Merik "Coinmaster" Vail**
- **City**: Emberfall
 - **Title:** Master of the Ashen Market
- **Alignment:** Neutral Evil
- **Race:** Tiefling
- **Age:** 48
- **Appearance:** Merik’s skin is deep crimson, with golden eyes that glint unnaturally in the firelight. His horns curve back elegantly, wrapped in gold wire and fragments of chain. He dresses in patchwork finery—robes stitched from banners taken from defeated enemies. His blackened fingernails always drum across the hilt of a dagger.
- **Temperament:** Calculating, ambitious, and ruthless. Merik’s grip on the market is absolute, enforced by both coin and blade. He thrives on the desperation of others, believing wealth should flow like blood—endlessly.
- **History:** Merik emerged from obscurity during the [[0092-04-17 - Emberfall - The Siege of Ember’s Wake]], smuggling supplies and weapons through enemy lines in exchange for gold and power. His actions saved the forges of Emberfall but damned entire villages in the outer lands, left defenseless after he redirected supplies. The Council of War couldn’t decide whether to reward or hang him—so they gave him the Ashen Market.
- **Rumors:** It is whispered that Merik struck a deal with Asmodean cultists during the Veilfire War, binding his soul to his coin. Those who owe him debts often vanish, their blood said to reappear as **new etchings on his horns.**
- **Backstory**: Emerged during the Siege of Ember's Wake, smuggling supplies and weapons through enemy lines in exchange for gold and power. His actions saved the forges of Emberfall but damned entire villages in the outer lands, left defenseless after he redirected supplies.

**Vallis Duskbrand**
- **City**: Emberfall
- **Title:** Quartermaster of the Bloodforge
- **Alignment:** Neutral Evil
- **Race:** Tiefling
- **Age:** 42
- **Appearance:**  
    Vallis is tall and lithe, with sleek black horns curving back across her silver hair. She dresses in simple yet well-tailored garb, her eyes glowing faintly red under the forge-light. A silver dagger hangs at her side, said to have never tasted blood—but many question that claim.
- **Temperament:**  
    Vallis is a pragmatic opportunist, running the **trade and smuggling operations** that supply the Bloodforge with exotic materials. She negotiates with clients no matter their allegiance, as long as their coin is good.
- **History:**  
    Vallis gained favor with Thaldrik by procuring rare Veilfire crystals during the early years of the war. Since then, she has been his most trusted supplier, though many accuse her of dealing with **Asmodean cultists**.
- **Rumors:**  
    Vallis’s dagger, _“Silverbrand,”_ supposedly burns demons but spares mortals. Some say she cut a devil’s tongue from its mouth with it.
- **Backstory**: Gained favor with Thaldrik by procuring rare Veilfire crystals during the early years of the war. Since then, she has been his most trusted supplier, though many accuse her of dealing with Asmodean cultists.

**Corsair-Queen Marla Greaves (Tiefling)**
- **City**: Emberfall
- - **Title:** Pirate Lord of Greaves' End
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral
- **Race:** Tiefling
- **Age:** 40
- **Appearance:** Marla’s horns curve back like the blades of a cutlass, and her crimson skin glows faintly under moonlight. Her left eye is a glass orb filled with seawater, constantly swirling with spectral shapes that drift within. She wears patchwork armor scavenged from fallen ships, her cloak stitched from the sails of vessels she’s sunk.
- **Temperament:** Wild, unpredictable, and fiercely independent. Marla sees herself as the sea’s chosen, destined to carve her legend in both waves and blood.
- **History:** Marla once plagued Emberfall as the most feared corsair along the Iron Marches’ coastlines. Now, she sails beneath Emberfall’s flag—not out of loyalty, but because the enemy she sees on the horizon terrifies even her.
- **Rumors:** Sailors believe Marla’s glass eye lets her see into the afterlife, guiding her through storms where the dead whisper directions. Others claim the eye is a curse, and that Marla’s soul has long since drowned.

**Arannis Duskwind (Tiefling)**
- **City**: Emberfall
- **Title:** Master Artificer (Deceased)
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral
- **Race:** Tiefling
- **Age:** 38 (at time of death)
- **Appearance:**  
    Arannis was known for his violet horns that curled backward like a crown. His leather robes shimmered faintly with residual Veilfire energy, and his left hand bore tattoos said to be self-inflicted, marking his experiments with forbidden sigils.
- **Temperament:**  
    Reckless but brilliant, Arannis viewed magic as a canvas for creation, often pushing the boundaries of ethical spellcraft. His arrogance led to as many victories as disasters.
- **History:**  
    Arannis died **sealing a magical rift** during the [[0099-03-10 - Emberfall - The Black Anvil Revolt]], sacrificing himself to prevent Emberfall from collapsing under arcane backlash. His chambers remain untouched, left as a memorial.
- **Rumors:**  
    Some believe Arannis’s spirit lingers in the Duskwind Chambers, appearing to those on the verge of magical breakthroughs.
- - **Backstory**: ==PENDING==
