## Halfling Lesser Leadership

**Jessa Flintfoot**
- **City**: Emberfall
- **Title:** Relic Merchant and Smuggler
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral
- **Race:** Halfling
- **Age:** 37
- **Appearance:** Jessa is small and wiry, her dark hair tied back beneath a leather hood. Her left ear is pierced with shards of Veilglass, and her hands are perpetually dirty, blackened with dust from forgotten crypts. A short sword hangs loosely at her waist, dulled by age but sharpened often.
- **Temperament:** Sly, unpredictable, and sharp-tongued. Jessa enjoys playing people against each other and thrives in the chaos of the market. She respects power but bows to no one, least of all Merik.
- **History:** Jessa made her name during the **Black Anvil Revolt**, smuggling relics through the burning streets of Emberfall. She’s known for finding artifacts others fear to touch, and many suspect her wares are cursed—or stolen from places better left undisturbed.
- **Rumors:** Some say Jessa carries a dagger carved from the heart of a fallen angel, and that it whispers warnings when death draws near. Others claim she sold her soul to avoid death during the revolt, though her smile never confirms it.
- **Backstory**: Made her name during the Black Anvil Revolt, smuggling relics through the burning streets of Emberfall. She's known for finding artifacts others fear to touch, and many suspect her wares are cursed—or stolen from places better left undisturbed.
