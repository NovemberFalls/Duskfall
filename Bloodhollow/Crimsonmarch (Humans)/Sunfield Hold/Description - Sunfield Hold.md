# Description

_“The sun sets on the fields, but it never sets on our watch.”_  
— Captain Lyra Steelheart

Sunfield Hold stands like a sentinel at the edge of humanity’s dominion, the first line of defense against the encroaching orc and goblin hordes. Built upon the bones of forgotten battles, its fortifications stretch across the valley pass, a wall of steel and stone that none breach without paying dearly in blood. The Hold’s towers glimmer with the banners of the Emberfall Legion, and its garrison remains ever vigilant.

The city is more fortress than dwelling. Barracks and siege engines fill every corner, while watchtowers pierce the sky, their horns ready to sound the call of war at the first sight of an enemy banner. The docks at Sunfield are not for trade—they serve as landing grounds for troop carriers and war machines bound for the northern fronts. To live in Sunfield Hold is to know that every dawn could bring death, and every dusk might be the last.
