### **Stonehaven – Structure and Layout**  
_"Stonehaven stands not by grace of gods, but by the sweat of calloused hands."_  
— Overseer Garrick Ironheart  

Stonehaven is the last beacon of industry and survival within the Shardpeak Mountains. A city carved into the heart of the stone itself, it is a testament to the unwavering bond between humans and dwarves. While war chokes the rest of Bloodhollow, Stonehaven endures as a vital source of iron, stone, and rare minerals that fuel the Crimsonmarch.

### **City Layout**  
Built vertically into the Shardpeak Mountains, Stonehaven spirals downward into the depths. Its design reflects dwarven architectural sensibilities—sturdy, functional, and unyielding. The city is divided into three major rings, each descending further into the mountain. Surface-level trade thrives, while the deeper sections hum with the rhythmic clang of forges and the pulse of ancient dwarven enchantments.  

- **The Outer Ring – The Surface Dock and Watchward**  
    This outermost district serves as the primary access point to Stonehaven. Guarded heavily, it houses trading posts, defensive structures, and essential services for surface travelers and merchants.  

- **Middle Ring – The Artisan’s Hollow**  
    The heart of craft and commerce. Blacksmiths, engineers, and miners work tirelessly here, producing tools, weapons, and armor. This district is bustling with dwarves and humans working in tandem, their shared expertise creating the finest metalwork in the realm.  

- **The Inner Ring – The Deepstone Ward**  
    Carved into the living rock, this is the most secure section of Stonehaven. The seat of dwarven governance and the heart of mining operations, it holds the city’s deepest mines, vaults of rare minerals, and the Great Forge of Ironsoul.

### **Navigation and Movement**  
**Lifts and Tunnels**  
Stonehaven relies on intricate lifts and underground tunnels for movement between the rings. Dwarven lifts, powered by gear and rune, ferry people and goods swiftly. Guarded tunnels provide secure paths between districts, with checkpoints at key intersections.  

**Travel Methods**  
- **Carts and Wagons:** Used primarily in the Artisan’s Hollow for transporting goods.  
- **On Foot:** Most common, particularly within the mines and forges.  
- **Runic Elevators:** Secure and efficient, leading to the Deepstone Ward.    

Stonehaven thrives not on luxury, but through labor, sweat, and steel. It is a city that endures—because in Bloodhollow, endurance is survival.
