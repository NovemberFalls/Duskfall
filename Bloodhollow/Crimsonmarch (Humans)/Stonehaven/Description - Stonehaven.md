# Description

_“The mountain does not forgive, and neither do we.”_  
— Overseer Garrick Ironheart

Carved into the side of the Shardpeak Mountains, Stonehaven is the last surviving mining outpost of humanity, a city of iron and stone where dwarven architecture shapes every corner. Its streets wind deep into the mountain’s flesh, descending through layers of forges, tunnels, and magma-lit halls. Dwarven banners hang beside human standards, symbolizing the fragile alliance that keeps Stonehaven alive.

The dwarven council oversees the city's defenses, ensuring that Stonehaven thrives despite constant raids from orc warbands. The clang of hammers never ceases, and black smoke spills from great chimneys day and night. Stonehaven’s docks cling to the mountain’s edge, narrow piers extending over deep, black waters where dwarven vessels laden with ore set sail under torchlight.
