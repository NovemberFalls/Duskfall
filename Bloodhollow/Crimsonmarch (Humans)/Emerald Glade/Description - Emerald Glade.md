# Description

_“Peace costs gold, and here, gold flows as freely as wine.”_  
— Duchess Seraphina Luxwood

Emerald Glade lies far from the smoke and screams of battle, hidden within lush green fields that remain untouched by war’s cruel hand. Here, the nobility and merchants live in decadent splendor, draped in silks and swathed in indulgence. Marble estates, crafted by elven artisans long before the Veilfire War, sprawl across the rolling hills, their towers glittering with emerald mosaics.

The Glade is a sanctuary where the privileged retreat to escape the suffering that gnaws at the rest of Bloodhollow. Beneath the surface, however, lies a silent war of ambition. Politics bleed through the tapestries, and alliances shift as quickly as the tides. Yet the Glade thrives, insulated by the wealth of trade and the silver tongues of those who rule it. To cross its gates is to leave the world behind, but not without a cost.
