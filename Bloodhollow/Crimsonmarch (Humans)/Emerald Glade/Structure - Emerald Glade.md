### **Emerald Glade – Structure and Layout**  
_"In Emerald Glade, the sound of coin is louder than the call to war."_  
— Duchess Seraphina Luxwood  

Emerald Glade stands as a sanctuary for the elite, far removed from the fires of war that define the rest of the Crimsonmarch. Draped in wealth and protected by influence, the city is a haven of luxury and ambition. Its layout reflects a desire for separation—nobility dwelling above the common rabble, and power balanced delicately within gardens of silver and marble.

### **City Layout**  
Emerald Glade’s design prioritizes elegance and exclusivity. Each district ascends in tiers, symbolizing the social hierarchy. At the pinnacle lies the domain of nobility, while artisans and merchants dwell below in splendor. The lower sections, though wealthier than most cities, are reserved for attendants, performers, and service trades.  

- **The Outer Ring – The Jade Row**  
    This ring forms the commercial heart of the Glade. Lavish shops, performers' theaters, and expansive markets cater to the desires of the wealthy. The area also houses the city’s workforce, filled with skilled artisans and traders who operate beneath the watchful eyes of the elite.    

- **Middle Ring – The Golden Court**  
    The Golden Court contains sprawling estates, secluded gardens, and the opulent villas of merchant lords and lesser nobles. Here, politics flows like wine, and power is won through subtlety rather than force.  

- **The Inner Ring – The Gladeheart**  
    At the highest point of Emerald Glade sits the Gladeheart, a district reserved for the highest echelons of nobility. The Ducal Palace, the Seat of Serenity, and the Sunspire Tower dominate this section. Those who dwell here do so with the assurance that war is a distant whisper.

### **Navigation and Movement**  
**Checkpoints and Wards**

Emerald Glade thrives as a haven of excess and indulgence, where the shadows of war remain distant and ambition reigns supreme.
