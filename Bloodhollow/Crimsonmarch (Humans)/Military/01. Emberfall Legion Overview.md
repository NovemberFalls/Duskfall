### Combat Status System
A separate honor system that overlays all ranks and paths:

- **Veteran Champion:** Highest combat distinction
- **Ironborn Veteran:** Proven combat veteran
- **Ironborn Warrior:** Basic combat distinction

[[02. Combat Status Qualifications]] can be earned by any member of any path and provides additional authority in combat situations without changing formal rank.

## Basic Command Structure

### Chain of Command
- Rank level takes absolute precedence
- Within same level, authority depends on situation:
  - Military Command leads combat operations
  - Inquisitorial Path leads religious/security matters
  - War-Mage Path leads magical threats

### Special Positions
- **Wardens:** Command specific locations/fortifications
- **The Emberward:** Elite garrison forces
- **Cathedral Militant:** Religious warriors
- **Chainhold Guards:** Prison wardens

## Progression and Training

### Basic Requirements
- All paths start as Initiates
- Combat experience required
- Path-specific training and trials
- Minimum service times for advancement

### Specialization
- Chosen after achieving base competence
- Cannot usually switch between paths
- Can earn Combat Status in any path
- Additional training for specific roles
