### **Emberfall – Structure and Layout**

_"Emberfall’s walls hold more than stone. They hold the weight of every sacrifice made to keep this empire breathing."_  
— Aldric Blackthorn, Lord Commander of Emberfall

Emberfall is not a city of peace; it is a war machine disguised as civilization. Its very design reflects the uncompromising nature of the Crimsonmarch, with every structure reinforcing the city’s dual role as both capital and fortress.

---

### **City Layout**

Emberfall’s layout is organized into distinct districts, each serving a specific function within the war-driven empire. Massive outer walls encircle the entire city, with multiple layers of defense separating the districts. Movement between sections is heavily controlled by checkpoints and guarded gates, ensuring no part of Emberfall lies vulnerable to internal or external threats.

- **The Outer Ring – The Iron Marches**  
    This sprawling area surrounds the city proper and serves as the first line of defense. Guard towers, barracks, and training grounds dominate the landscape. The Iron Marches house Emberfall’s standing armies and conscripted militias, ready to deploy at a moment’s notice. Weapon forges and siege workshops line the inner sections, constantly producing instruments of war.
    
- **Middle Ring – The Anvil**  
    The heart of production and trade. Blacksmiths, armories, and foundries churn endlessly to supply the Crimsonmarch with arms and armor. Mercantile businesses, apothecaries, and alchemical workshops blend into the industrial sprawl. Inns and taverns here cater to soldiers and craftsmen, their walls thick with soot and iron.
    
- **The Inner Ring – The Emberheart**  
    At the city’s core lies the Emberheart, Emberfall’s true power center. This district houses the High Keep, the seat of the Lord Commander, and the Council of War. The Emberheart is heavily patrolled and fortified with runed stone, its streets lined with statues of fallen heroes and tyrant-kings. Only the elite reside within these walls, and access is restricted to those of rank or importance.

The first line of defense, the Iron Marches encircle the city like a great scarred barrier.
