### **Overview:**

The **Cathedral of Tyr’s Judgment** is not simply a place of worship—it is a fortress of divine retribution. Built during the early days of the Crimsonmarch, the cathedral serves as both tribunal and sanctuary, where the righteous and condemned alike stand beneath the gaze of Tyr, the god of justice and war.

The structure is both revered and feared by the populace. Trials held within the cathedral’s grand sanctum are often public, with sentences carried out beneath the cold light of magical flames said to burn away deceit. For many, it is the last place they will see.

The **Council of War** frequently holds ceremonies here, invoking the blessings of Tyr before marching to battle. Paladins and inquisitors patrol the cathedral’s grounds relentlessly, ensuring that no shadow dares linger within the seat of divine law.

### **Structures and Layout:**

- **The Hall of Scales:**  
    A grand chamber where judgments are passed. In the center of the hall rests the **Scales of Veilfire**, an ancient artifact believed to glow brighter in the presence of lies. Accused war criminals, traitors, and deserters stand trial here under the piercing gaze of Tyr’s statue.
- **The Bell of Penance:**  
    Suspended above the eastern tower, this enormous iron bell tolls whenever a high-profile execution or trial is announced. Its deep chime echoes across the entire city, a reminder that justice in Emberfall is neither blind nor deaf.
- **The Veilforged Crypt:**  
    A subterranean vault beneath the cathedral, where the remains of honored inquisitors and paladins are interred. The crypt is guarded by **The Silent Order**, a sect of paladins who have sworn eternal silence.
- **The Tribunal Wing:**  
    An annex where inquisitors operate, compiling intelligence, extracting confessions, and preparing charges against those accused of heresy, treason, or consorting with Bane’ disciples.
- **Shrine of the Martyrs:**  
    A smaller chamber honoring those who gave their lives in defense of Emberfall during the **Veilfire War**. The names of the fallen are etched in silver along the marble walls.
