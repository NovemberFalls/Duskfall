### **Emberfall Garrison (Inner Division) – The Fangs of the Emberheart**

_"The walls may crack, the gates may break, but the men and women who stand within this garrison do not."_  
— Commander Hadric Thornwall

The **Emberfall Garrison (Inner Division)** lies at the very core of the Emberheart, serving as the last bastion of defense within the Inner Ring. Clad in reinforced stone and enchanted steel, the garrison houses Emberfall’s most elite warriors—**the Ironbound Guard**—those who answer directly to the **Lord Commander** and the **Council of War**.

The garrison is far more than barracks; it is a living testament to the city’s militaristic roots, **forged in the fires of the Veilfire War** and sharpened across decades of conflict. It serves as both the final staging ground for military operations and the command hub for Emberfall’s inner defense.

When the outer walls crumble, the garrison remains—the last unbroken spear of humanity against the dark tides that seek to claim the city.

### **Structures and Key Locations**

- **The Ironhall** – The largest chamber within the garrison, where war councils are held beneath the banners of every campaign fought in Emberfall’s name. A great obsidian table dominates the center, carved with the map of the Crimsonmarch. Only **senior officers and commanders** may speak here.
- **The Vault of Ash** – A restricted armory storing enchanted weapons and relics seized during the Veilfire War. Access is tightly controlled by **Quartermaster Arlen Blackbrook**, and each item is sealed behind runic locks forged by dwarven artisans.
- **The Gauntlet Grounds** – The training yard for the Ironbound Guard, where combat trials and war simulations occur regularly. **Captain Isolde Veyne** personally oversees these trials, ensuring that every recruit understands the weight of the blade they wield.
- **The Redwatch Tower** – A smaller tower attached to the garrison, used for surveillance over the Emberheart district. The tower’s beacon ignites red when the Inner Ring is breached.
- **The Gilded Barracks** – Quarters reserved for the highest-ranking officers of the Ironbound Guard. These barracks stand above the rest of the garrison, offering direct views of the **High Keep** and the **Cathedral of Tyr’s Judgment**.

### **Daily Life and Operations**

- **The Ironbound Muster** – At sunrise and dusk, the Ironbound Guard assembles in the Gauntlet Grounds for drills and combat practice. Attendance is mandatory, and absentees face immediate discipline.
- **Wargames and Siegetrials** – Recruits are tested in **live combat scenarios**, often pitted against controlled Veilfire constructs conjured within the spire. Surviving these trials earns them the right to wield garrison-forged weapons.
- **Artifact Inspections** – Twice a month, Arlen Blackbrook conducts a full inventory of the Vault of Ash, ensuring no relics have been tampered with or gone missing.
- **Tyr’s Vigil** – On the first night of every new month, **Commander Thornwall** leads a silent march through the garrison in honor of the fallen, concluding with a ceremony at the **Cathedral of Tyr’s Judgment**.

**The Emberfall Garrison stands eternal, its soldiers the last wall between chaos and the Emberheart. Those who serve within its halls do not merely defend Emberfall—they are its beating heart.**
