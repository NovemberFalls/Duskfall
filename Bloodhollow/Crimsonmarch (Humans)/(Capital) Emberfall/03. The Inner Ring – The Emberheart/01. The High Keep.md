## **The High Keep – Crown of the Crimsonmarch**

_"It is not the stone that shields Emberfall. It is the will of those who command it."_  
— Lord Commander Aldric Blackthorn

---

### **Location:**

- **The Emberheart District, Emberfall (Inner Ring)** – The High Keep towers at the heart of Emberfall, its black spires clawing at the sky. Positioned atop the highest plateau of the Inner Ring, the Keep overlooks the city below like a brooding sentinel.

### **Overview:**

The **High Keep** is both the seat of political power and the military nerve center of Emberfall. Built during the early years of the Veilfire War, the Keep was forged from **dark iron and obsidian quarried from the Wyrmtooh Range**. The walls hum faintly with the remnants of protective wards etched during the war's bloodiest years.

Home to **Lord Commander Aldric Blackthorn** and the **Council of War**, the Keep serves as a fortress, royal court, and war-room. It is a place where **alliances are forged, rebellions are extinguished,** and the fate of the Crimsonmarch is decided beneath the flicker of ancient Veilfire lanterns.

No citizen of Emberfall enters the High Keep uninvited. Its gates open only to those who carry the **Mark of Command**—a sigil of the Blackthorn lineage or by decree of the Lord Commander.

### **Structures and Layout:**

- **The Black Spire (War Room):**  
    The tallest tower within the Keep, where **strategies are devised and war councils held.** The chamber at its peak holds a massive iron table shaped like the continent of Bloodhollow. **Chancellor Roderic Vale** presides over most gatherings here in Aldric’s absence.
    
- **Hall of Tyrants:**  
    A long, vaulted hall lined with **statues of Emberfall’s past rulers and warlords.** It is said the air here carries the whispers of the dead, reminding current rulers of the cost of failure. This hall leads directly to the Throne of Ember.
    
- **The Throne of Ember:**  
    **A blackened steel throne,** forged from melted blades of fallen enemies. Lord Commander Blackthorn sits here during tribunals and decrees, his figure a reminder of unwavering judgment.
    
- **The Inner Vault (Relic Chamber):**  
    Beneath the Keep lies the **Inner Vault,** a sealed chamber that contains relics of the Veilfire War, including enchanted weapons, siege blueprints, and forbidden scrolls. Only the Lord Commander and Chancellor hold keys to this vault.
    
- **The Bastion Gate:**  
    The outermost defense of the Keep. This heavily fortified gate is guarded by **the Emberward—an elite division of knights** commanded by **Sir Lucan Duskfield.**

### **Daily Operations:**

- **War Councils:** Held twice per week in the Black Spire.
- **Tribunals:** Criminals and political dissidents are judged beneath the Throne of Ember.
- **Drills and Inspections:** Sir Lucan leads military drills every dawn in the Emberward Courtyard.

### **Quotes from the High Keep:**

- _“I do not sit on this throne for power. I sit here to ensure no one else ever takes it."_ – Aldric Blackthorn
- _“The quill wins battles before the sword is drawn.”_ – Chancellor Roderic Vale
- _“Emberfall is not held by walls but by the will of those within them.”_ – Sir Lucan Duskfield

The **High Keep** is not a palace; it is the iron heart of Emberfall. It stands as both crown and chain—ensuring that the flames of war, though distant, never fall dormant.
