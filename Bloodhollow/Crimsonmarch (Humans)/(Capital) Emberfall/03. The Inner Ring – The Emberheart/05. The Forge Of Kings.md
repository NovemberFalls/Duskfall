## **The Forge of Kings – Where Legends Are Tempered**

_"Steel alone does not birth kings. It is the fire beneath the forge, the strike of will against iron, that crowns them."_  
— Forge-Master Durain Hammerfall

### **Location:**

- **The Inner Ring, Emberfall** – Beneath the shadow of the High Keep, embedded within the ancient foundation stones of Emberfall, lies the **Forge of Kings**—a relic of the old world.

---

### **Overview:**

The **Forge of Kings** is no ordinary smithy. This sanctum of fire and steel is reserved for the crafting of **legendary weapons, armor, and relics** destined to shape the fate of nations. It stands as one of the oldest surviving forges in Bloodhollow, **predating even the founding of Emberfall.**

Dwarven runes cover its walls, humming with the faint echoes of ancient enchantments, and molten veins of Veilfire course beneath the forge like **the lifeblood of the mountain.** No common blade has ever left its hearth—only relics wielded by monarchs, warlords, and heroes are born here.

The forge is **sealed to all but the highest-ranking officials and master smiths,** requiring ritual blood-oaths to unlock its gates.

---

### **Structures and Key Locations:**

- **The Anvil of Crowns** – A massive, rune-carved anvil resting at the center of the forge, said to have **forged the first blades of the Crimsonmarch.** It hums with latent power, sparking faint blue under the light of the moon.
- **The Embervein Crucible** – A deep furnace that burns using **Veilfire-infused magma,** allowing for the crafting of weapons that hold both magical and physical properties. The flames within are believed to react violently to unworthy materials.
- **The Vault of Relics** – A sealed chamber beneath the forge, warded by dwarven and human enchantments, where **legendary weapons and failed experiments** are entombed. It is said that no weapon forged here can be destroyed—only returned to the vault when its wielder dies.
- **The Throne-Stone** – A ceremonial altar where rulers or generals **commission new weapons or armor,** offering relics or blood as tribute to the forge. Any weapon forged at the Throne-Stone is said to carry the soul of its maker.

---

### **Daily Operations and Rituals:**

- **The Smelting of Crowns** – Each year, the forge is sealed for seven days, during which time relics for Emberfall’s rulers are reforged or blessed anew. Only Durain and Varik are allowed within during this period.
- **Trial of Iron** – Smiths seeking to work the forge must undergo the **Trial of Iron,** surviving three days without food or water while forging a blade in complete silence. Most fail.
- **The Emberwake Ceremony** – When a ruler dies, their weapon is returned to the Forge of Kings, laid upon the **Throne-Stone,** and sealed beneath the Vault of Relics.

### **Quotes from the Forge:**

- _"A king is no different from his sword—both will shatter if forged poorly."_ – Forge-Master Durain Hammerfall
- _"Steel bends. Will does not."_ – Arch-Enchanter Varik Thorne
- _"The flames beneath the forge do not lie. They burn truth into the blade."_ – Unknown Apprentice

**The Forge of Kings** is more than a smithy—it is a monument to Emberfall’s legacy, shaping the weapons that will either crown new monarchs or bury them beneath the smoldering ashes of war.
