### **The Black Bastion – Heart of the Ironborn**  
_"Where steel is forged, so too are the men who wield it."_  
— General Darius Crownhold  

**The Black Bastion** stands as the largest military installation within Emberfall, a sprawling fortress complex located deep within the **Iron Marches**. It is the beating heart of the Emberfall Legion, housing barracks, war forges, and the Legion’s command center. Soldiers refer to it as **“The Bastion of Unbroken Iron”**, a name earned through centuries of relentless defense against the enemies of Bloodhollow.  

Thick, black stone walls enclose the Bastion, with battlements reinforced by dwarven runes and enchanted steel. Flames from the great forge pits light the sky at night, and the rhythmic clash of hammers echoes day and night. **The Ironborn**, Emberfall’s elite standing force, train ceaselessly within these walls, forging weapons and preparing for the eternal wars beyond the gate.

### **Structures and Defenses**  
- **Warforged Parade Grounds:** The open fields within the Bastion’s walls serve as training and drilling grounds for Emberfall’s soldiers. At dawn, the air trembles with the marching of battalions under the gaze of hardened veterans.  
- **The Armory of the Unyielding:** A vast armory carved beneath the Bastion, where enchanted weapons and siege equipment are stored. The Ironborn often refer to it as **“The Vault”**.  
- **Siegecraft Hall:** A specialized workshop dedicated to the construction of trebuchets, ballistae, and dwarven-engineered siege weaponry.  
- **Bastion Forge:** The largest forge within Emberfall, powered by molten veins that run beneath the Marches. Blacksmiths and runecrafters work tirelessly here to outfit the Legion.  
- **Hall of Blades:** A ceremonial hall where swords of fallen commanders are displayed, a reminder of the Bastion’s long and bloody legacy.

- **Command Assemblies:** General Crownhold holds war councils in the **Hall of Blades**, where tactical decisions for Emberfall’s defense are made.  
- **Recruitment:** The Black Bastion serves as the main recruitment center for Emberfall’s outer guard, the **Ironborn**, and siege engineers.

**The Black Bastion is not simply a fortress; it is the forge upon which Emberfall’s strength is tempered, and where weakness is shattered like brittle steel.**
