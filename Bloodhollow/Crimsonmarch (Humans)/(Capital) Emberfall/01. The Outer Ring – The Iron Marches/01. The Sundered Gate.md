s### **The Sundered Gate – The Iron Veil of Emberfall**  
_"Stone and steel may break, but the gate stands eternal."_  
— Warden Alric Stoneveil  

**The Sundered Gate** is the primary entrance to Emberfall, a colossal structure of black iron and stone that looms at the outermost ring of the city. Scarred by countless sieges yet never breached, it stands as a monument to the resilience and iron will of the Crimsonmarch.  

The gate’s surface is engraved with runic wards, pulsing faintly with the magic of the dwarven forges that birthed it. Flanking the gate are two towering bastions, each bristling with ballistae, enchanted flame-throwers, and murder holes. The walls extend outward like the jaws of a beast, funneling attackers into a kill zone known as **The Veil’s Throat**—a narrow passage designed to channel enemy forces into direct confrontation with entrenched defenders.  

The Sundered Gate has a dark reputation; beneath it lies **The Silent Path**, a hidden tunnel said to run beneath the Iron Marches, used only in the direst of times. Few know of its existence, and fewer still have returned from its depths.
