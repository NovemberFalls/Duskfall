### **The Rusted Gauntlet – Emberfall’s Blunt Edge**

_"You don’t walk into the Gauntlet. You crawl out."_  
— Helka Ironfist

The **Rusted Gauntlet** is the largest inn within Emberfall’s Outer Ring, a battered leviathan of timber and iron standing defiantly along Smelter’s Row. Its walls creak with age and violence, soaked in ale and blood alike. Unlike the iron-shackled pits of the lower forges, the Gauntlet rises, four stories tall with enough rooms to house mercenaries, wanderers, and the desperate souls clinging to Emberfall’s embers.

Three breweries churn endlessly beneath its floors, filling the air with the sour tang of strong drink. Above, rickety staircases wind to the upper levels, where rows of splintered doors offer crude shelter.

Weapons rarely cross the threshold. Morvyn “Redtooth” Blight, the pit-fighter turned innkeep, ensures patrons leave their steel at the entrance. But fists? Fists are the language of the Gauntlet, and few leave without learning to speak it.

### **Structures and Layout**

- **The Gauntlet Floor** – A vast, open hall reinforced by thick oak beams—half of which bear axe notches and sword scars. Long tables dominate the space, often littered with cards, dice, and shattered mugs. In the center yawns a fighting pit, enclosed by jagged wood railings. It sees nightly use, often ending in bruises or broken bones.
- **The Brewer’s Pit** – Beneath the main floor lies the Brewer’s Pit, where three interconnected breweries labor under Varek Ironmoor’s iron rule. The brew is harsh, often tasting of smoke and rust, but no one complains—not unless they wish to taste Varek’s hammer.
- **The Broken Loft** – The upper three floors house mercenaries, wanderers, and fugitives. Each level sags slightly from years of bar fights, careless magic, and collapsing bodies. Rooms are simple, marked by doors so thin that whispered plots leak through the wood like blood through cloth.
- **The Chain Wall** – Instead of a memorial, the Gauntlet boasts the **Chain Wall** behind the bar—a crisscrossing weave of rusted weapons, broken blades, and shattered shields taken from those who fell in the pit or didn’t pay their debts. Each bears the name of its former owner, scratched into the steel by Tavik "The Quiet," the Gauntlet’s silent broker of contracts.

### **Daily Life and Operations**

- **Fist for a Room** – New patrons are required to fight for their first drink or room. It’s tradition. Morvyn watches the outcome from behind the bar, his one good eye gleaming. Victory earns respect; defeat often earns laughter—and a second chance if you stand up fast enough.
    
- **Blade Nights** – Once a month, the Gauntlet becomes more than a tavern—it becomes an arena. **Blade Night** pits mercenaries and sellswords against one another in brutal single combat. The prize? Free lodging for a month and their name etched into the Chain Wall. The losers? Their gear often finds a new home beneath the floorboards.
    
- **The Rusted Ledger** – Behind the bar, Tavik updates his **Rusted Ledger**—a record of mercenary contracts, bounty marks, and smuggler jobs. Names linger long after the bodies have vanished, and some say signing your name in the ledger carries a curse of inevitable violence.
    
- **The Forgotten Mug** – An iron mug sits at the end of the bar, untouched and cold. Some say it belonged to the last man foolish enough to draw steel inside the Gauntlet. His bones were never found, and the mug remains as a silent warning.

**The Rusted Gauntlet doesn’t offer shelter. It offers survival—and most who enter leave with more than just scars.**
