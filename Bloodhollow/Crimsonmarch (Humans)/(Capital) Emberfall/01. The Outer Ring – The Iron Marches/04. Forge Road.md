d### **Forge Road – The Spine of Emberfall**

_"On Forge Road, the air isn’t just thick with smoke—it’s heavy with judgment."_  
— Blackhand Rovan Gael

**Forge Road** is no simple industrial strip. It is the **spine of Emberfall**, a place where iron never cools, and the skies above are permanently stained black by the breath of the forges. The road itself is a jagged artery of molten steel, grinding gears, and hammer strikes that echo day and night, a reminder that Emberfall’s lifeblood is war—and war is fueled by iron.

The very stones along Forge Road are scorched, warped by centuries of heat from the endless lines of forges and smelters. The forgemasters who rule this stretch are hardened souls, their flesh seared, and their lungs filled with smoke, yet they work with a religious fervor. Each strike of the hammer is a prayer, each weapon crafted a hymn of defiance against the enemies who dare press against Emberfall’s borders.

### **Structures and Key Locations**

- **The Crucible Gates** – The gateway to Forge Road, marked by towering steel gates flanked by molten channels that glow through the night. Anyone entering must pass beneath the ever-burning pyres that serve as both symbol and warning—no soul leaves Forge Road without being changed.
- **Ironfather’s Stair** – A spiraling stone watchtower overlooking the entire stretch. From here, Emberfall’s foremen oversee the forges like grim judges, issuing orders or punishments with the clang of a bell.
- **The Molten Spine** – A chain of interconnected foundries, each one hotter than the last. This unbroken stretch of fire and steel forms the backbone of Forge Road. Weapons, armor, and siege engines are shaped here, and any mistake is paid for in sweat—or blood.
- **The Black Gauntlet** – A mercenary forge where only coin speaks. Here, weapon orders too dangerous or controversial for the Emberfall council are fulfilled, no questions asked. Those who deal with the Gauntlet often leave richer—but fewer leave unscarred.
- **Ashgate Memorial** – A soot-covered shrine built from melted weapons of fallen warriors. Dwarven runes flicker faintly beneath layers of ash, marking the names of Emberfall’s greatest blacksmiths, lost in the fires they once commanded.

### **Daily Life and Operations**

- **The Furnace March** – Each dawn, forgemasters lead their smiths down Forge Road, carrying blackened banners soaked in oil. This ritual parade signifies the beginning of the day’s labor and pays homage to the forges that have stood for centuries.
- **The Branding Trials** – Apprentices seeking to become master blacksmiths must forge a weapon during the night, using flames pulled directly from the Molten Spine. Those who succeed earn a brand upon their forearm. Those who fail often earn something worse.
- **Veilfire Bonding** – Select weapons forged along Forge Road are bathed in Veilfire during special ceremonies, granting them strange and potent enchantments—though some whisper the process binds the souls of the smiths who craft them.
- **The Ember Wards** – Mirea Ashthorn’s forges are known to produce unstable weapons that require magical seals. These blades are kept in the Ember Wards, an underground chamber where even the air itself hums with restrained power.

**Forge Road does not forge blades. It forges war—and those too weak to withstand its fire are left as nothing more than ash.**
