### **The Crimson Docks – Emberfall’s Iron Harbor**

_"No ship leaves these docks clean. Saltwater washes away nothing—only blood does."_  
— Corsair-Queen Marla Greaves

The **Crimson Docks** stretch like jagged iron along Emberfall’s coast, a fortress of chains, rust, and blackened hulls. Warships moored here seem less like vessels and more like beasts, their prows sharpened into rams, and their sides lined with enchanted cannons and siege weapons. The docks groan under the weight of ironclad monstrosities, their hulls reinforced by dwarven craft and cursed by the whispers of Tiefling sorcerers.

Even the sea is said to recoil from the docks, as if the water itself fears the ships that leave port. Sailors swear the tide runs thicker, darker, as if soaked in the blood of those lost beyond the horizon.

### **Structures and Defenses**

- **The Leviathan Chains** – Great iron chains stretch beneath the surface of the water, ready to rise at the command of Emberfall’s naval mages. They ensnare enemy ships, locking them in place while siege engines along the coast reduce them to splinters.
- **Dockyard 13 – “The Shipgrave”** – The most cursed of Emberfall’s dockyards. Here, ships are repaired not with fresh wood but with the bones of those vessels that died at sea. Whispers persist that the hulls groan with the memories of drowned sailors.
- **Black Tides Bastion** – A towering fortress overlooking the docks, armed with long-range cannons forged by the **Ironmoor Dwarves**. It acts as the final bastion against seaborne invasion. Its garrison is filled with marines who spend more time fighting dockside brawls than drills.
- **Greaves’ End** – A derelict section of the docks turned haven for corsairs under the watch of **Marla Greaves**, a notorious pirate turned begrudging defender of Emberfall’s waters. Her fleet of ragged warships patrols the outer seas, their sails black as the depths beneath.
- **The Bloodcoast Yards** – Where ships destined for war are born. Harbormaster Varek Ironmoor’s forge hums day and night, casting armor-plated vessels capable of weathering not just storms, but volleys of Veilfire and dragonflame.

The **Crimson Docks** serve as Emberfall’s iron backbone at sea—a place where warships are born and traitors are sunk beneath the tide. Let me know if you would like further elaboration on any part of this!
