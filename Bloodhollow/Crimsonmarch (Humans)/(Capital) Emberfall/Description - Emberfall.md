_“The light here is not hope. It is the flame that burns away weakness.”_  
— Lord Commander Aldric Blackthorn

Emberfall stands as the unyielding heart of humanity’s domain, the burning beacon that defies the dying world. Its walls, reforged from the bones of fallen avatars and blackened steel, rise like jagged scars against the dark horizon. This is not a city—it is a fortress shaped by war and tempered by the blood of countless battles. Emberfall’s docks groan beneath the weight of iron-clad warships, their hulls bristling with cannons and siege weapons crafted in the dwarven forges of Grimhaldir.

The streets are narrow and grim, lined with barracks and watchtowers. Statues of fallen heroes loom over squares where soldiers march in endless drills. Every soul who walks these streets carries the weight of the Veilfire War, their eyes sharp, their hearts steeled. This is not a place for the weak. Emberfall’s citizens know only service—to falter is to invite the hammer of judgment.
