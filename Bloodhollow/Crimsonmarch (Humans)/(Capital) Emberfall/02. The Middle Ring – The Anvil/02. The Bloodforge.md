## **The Bloodforge – Emberfall’s Veins of Iron and Fire**

_"Steel is a patient god. And I am its priest."_  
— Thaldrik Coalhammer

### **Location:**

- **The Anvil District, Emberfall**
- Carved into the southern quarter of Emberfall’s industrial sprawl, the **Bloodforge** rises like a monolithic scar of black iron and fire. Its smokestacks claw at the sky, shrouding the Anvil District in perpetual haze.

### **Overview:**

The **Bloodforge** is the largest and oldest operational forge in Emberfall, predating even the Veilfire War. It stands as a testament to the unrelenting demands of war and industry. Unlike other forges that shutter after peacetime, the Bloodforge **never ceases production**. War machines, siege engines, and blades meant for mass bloodshed are its primary exports.

The forge earned its name during the **[[0093-09-01 - Emberfall - The Battle Of Ashgate Approach]]** when molten slag, poured from its vats, helped seal the breaches in Emberfall’s defenses. The iron collected from the dead was reforged into weapons—some say those blades carried the whispers of the fallen.

### **Structures and Layout:**

- **The Crucible Hall:**  
    The forge’s central chamber, where weapons are tested under brutal conditions. It’s not uncommon for weapons to shatter in the hands of unworthy wielders. Only weapons that survive the Hall are sold under the Bloodforge name.
    
- **The Iron Vein:**  
    An underground network of forges, this section is reserved for experimental designs—**dwarven automatons**, **golem frames**, and **crude airship schematics** smolder in the depths. Entry is restricted to master smiths.
    
- **The Forgeheart:**  
    A **magma-fed forge**, powered by Grimhaldir’s dwarves through channels of molten rock. It is said the Forgeheart can melt dragonbone, though few live to see such feats.
    
- **Smelter’s Watch:**  
    A towering bastion overlooking the forge, where **Thaldrik Coalhammer** holds court over his workers. From here, the forge master tracks all production and controls the forging quotas.

### **Daily Operations:**

- **Weapon Production:** The Bloodforge produces over half of Emberfall’s siege weapons, armor, and enchanted wargear. Its foundries run day and night.
- **Enchantment Contracts:** Dwarven artificers imbue weapons with runes that enhance their strength or grant flame-wreathed edges.
- **Black Market Deals:** Vallis Duskbrand orchestrates illegal relic deals, smuggling cursed and forgotten weapons through Emberfall’s underground channels.

**The Bloodforge** isn’t merely a place where weapons are made—it is where **Emberfall’s soul is tempered in fire and iron.** Here, death and industry walk hand in hand, and the clang of hammers echoes the silent prayers of soldiers who will carry its steel into the endless dark.
