### **The Ashen Market – Where War and Coin Collide**

_"You want steel that’s never been used? Go elsewhere. In the Ashen Market, everything’s tasted blood."_  
— Merik "Coinmaster" Vail

The **Ashen Market** hums with life, a chaotic artery of trade at the heart of **The Anvil District**. It is no ordinary market—here, iron still warm from the forge changes hands, enchanted blades rest side by side with cursed relics, and mercenary contracts are sold like fruit.

Scorched by the fires of past battles, the market wears its name as a scar. Much of it was burned during the **[[0093-09-01 - Emberfall - The Battle Of Ashgate Approach]]**, and the blackened stone beneath the stalls remains untouched as a reminder that in Emberfall, even commerce bleeds.

Vendors sell everything from salvaged weapons to siege remnants, and the air constantly smells of smelted iron and burnt parchment. Deals are struck with whispered bargains, but every coin spent carries the weight of war.

### **Structures and Layout**

- **The Iron Spine** – The main stretch of the market, a long avenue lined with crumbling statues of warlords and saints. Stalls cluster along the road, built from scrap metal and scavenged wood. Overhead, rusted chains clatter in the wind.
- **The Black Anvil** – A massive auction house where enchanted weapons, relics, and war machines are sold to the highest bidder. Once a forge, it was repurposed after the [[0099-03-10 - Emberfall - The Black Anvil Revolt]], its anvil now resting in the corner as a trophy.
- **Ashgate Row** – A darker section of the market, shrouded in thick smoke. This area houses black-market traders, smugglers, and relic hunters willing to sell cursed artifacts with no questions asked.
- **The Ember Circle** – A small plaza at the heart of the market, marked by a cracked stone mosaic. It serves as a gathering point for mercenaries seeking work, and it is said that the blood spilled here stains the stones permanently.
- **Thaldrik’s Forge** – A relic from the [[0093-09-01 - Emberfall - The Battle Of Ashgate Approach]], this small forge survived the fires and still operates under the hand of **Thaldrik Coalhammer**, one of the defenders from that fateful day.

**The Ashen Market is not a place for the faint-hearted. It stands as a scarred reminder that even in commerce, war never sleeps.**
