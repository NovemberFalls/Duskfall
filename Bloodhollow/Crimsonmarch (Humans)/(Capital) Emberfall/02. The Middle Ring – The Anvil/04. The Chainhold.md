## **The Chainhold – Emberfall’s Iron Grasp**

_"A man’s worth is weighed not in coin, but in the weight of the chains he drags."_  
— High Inquisitor Varik Duskwatch

### **Location:**

- **The Anvil District, Emberfall** – Carved into the underbelly of the Anvil, beneath the industrial smog and forges, lies the **Chainhold**, Emberfall’s infamous prison and interrogation fortress.

---

### **Overview:**

The **Chainhold** serves as **Emberfall’s primary prison and interrogation center,** housing criminals, war prisoners, and political dissidents. Unlike typical prisons, the Chainhold operates not as a place of justice but of **fear, punishment, and extraction**.
Built during the height of the Veilfire War, the fortress extends deep into the stone beneath the Anvil. The lower levels, known as the **Deep Iron**, descend so far that even dwarven masons hesitate to venture into the furthest cells.
The prison is infamous for its brutal “**Veilfire Judgments**,” where traitors are subjected to **runed flames** capable of peeling the soul from the body. Few leave the Chainhold alive—those who do often return to society as hollow echoes of their former selves.

### **Structures and Layout:**

- **The Iron Gate** – The only visible entrance to the Chainhold, guarded by **Ironborn Wardens** day and night. The Iron Gate features massive runed doors that can only be opened by the **High Inquisitor’s Seal.**
- **Judgment Hall** – The heart of the Chainhold where prisoners are judged. The hall’s iron thrones overlook the Veilfire Pit, and **High Inquisitor Varik Duskwatch** presides over public executions or interrogations.
- **The Deep Iron** – The lowest levels of the Chainhold, where the worst prisoners are kept. It is said that the air here hums with the whispers of those long forgotten. Some claim the walls bleed Veilfire at night.
- **The Iron Veins** – Tunnels branching off the Deep Iron, originally mining shafts repurposed into prison cells. Prisoners are shackled directly to the rock walls, often left to mine their own graves.
- **The Black Chain** – A central elevator shaft running through the core of the Chainhold, transporting prisoners and supplies between levels. The lift is powered by dwarven machinery, driven by molten iron.

### **Daily Operations:**

- **Interrogations and Trials:** Prisoners are hauled before **Varik Duskwatch** weekly, where confessions are extracted through Veilfire branding.
- **Mining Operations:** The Iron Veins continue to produce ore, as prisoners are shackled and forced to work.
- **Public Spectacles:** Every third week, executions are conducted within the **Judgment Hall** as a reminder to Emberfall’s citizens.

### **Quotes from the Chainhold:**

- _“A traitor’s breath is worth less than the air it steals.”_ – High Inquisitor Varik Duskwatch
- _“The Chainhold never forgets. Neither do its walls.”_ – Warden Elric Stonebrand
- _“I break men like I break steel—slowly, until they no longer remember the shape they once held.”_ – Jorrik Blackthorn

The Chainhold stands as more than a prison. It is **the iron spine of Emberfall’s authority,** where enemies of the Crimsonmarch vanish into the Deep Iron, never to return whole.
