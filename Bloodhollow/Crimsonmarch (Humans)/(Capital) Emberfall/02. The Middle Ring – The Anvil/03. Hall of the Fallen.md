## **The Hall of the Fallen – Sanctuary of Steel and Stone**

_"The dead do not rest easily in Emberfall, but here, at least, they are remembered."_  
— High Cleric Malrik Dawnward

### **Location:**

- **The Anvil District, Emberfall**  
    Nestled along the western edge of the Anvil District, the **Hall of the Fallen** is the largest sanctum within Emberfall, second only to the **Cathedral of Tyr’s Judgment**. Its towering spires, dark and weathered by time, serve as both a temple and infirmary—a place where the wounded come to heal, and the dead are laid to rest.

### **Overview:**

Built during the height of the **Veilfire War**, the Hall of the Fallen serves as a **memorial, hospital, and reliquary** dedicated to those who perished defending Emberfall. Unlike the grandiose temples of the Inner Ring, the Hall was **forged from repurposed stone and melted weaponry**—remnants of the countless battles fought along Emberfall’s borders.

The Hall's great iron doors are flanked by statues of **dwarven and human warriors** holding shattered blades, symbolizing both the cost of war and the resilience it breeds. At its heart lies the **Veilfire Pyre**, an eternal flame fueled by the remnants of Veilfire crystals gathered after the **[[0099-09-01 - Emberfall - The Blackroot Siege]]**. This fire is said to keep the souls of the fallen warm, preventing them from slipping into darkness.

### **Structures and Layout:**

- **The Memorial Walk:**  
    A long corridor lined with engraved stone tablets bearing the names of those lost in key battles—**Ashgate Approach, the Siege of Ember’s Wake,** and **the Blackroot Siege** among them. Each step echoes softly, as if the Hall itself mourns the weight it carries.
    
- **The Veilfire Pyre:**  
    Suspended in the Hall’s central chamber, the **Veilfire Pyre** burns endlessly, crackling with blue and silver flames. Weapons of Emberfall’s greatest defenders—both broken and whole—are hung in concentric circles around the pyre, forming a radiant spiral of steel.
    
- **The Silent Chapel:**  
    A smaller annex behind the pyre, reserved for personal vigils and prayers. It is often used by survivors and grieving families to commune with the memory of the fallen. Many claim to hear faint whispers in the chapel, though the priests dismiss this as mere superstition.
    
- **The Iron Wards:**  
    The eastern wing functions as an infirmary, staffed by clerics and healers trained in both divine magic and practical medicine. **Dwarven rune-menders** work alongside human priests, ensuring that even cursed wounds left by Veilfire can be treated.

**The Hall of the Fallen** is not merely a memorial; it is the heart of Emberfall’s remembrance. Here, past and present intertwine, and the fires of war continue to burn long after the swords are sheathed.
