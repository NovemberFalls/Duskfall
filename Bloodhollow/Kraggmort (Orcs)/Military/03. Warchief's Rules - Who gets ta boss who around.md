# Da Warchief's Rules

*"Ya got two ways ta lead - be strong enough dat they follow, or be dead. Dat's all da rules ya need."*  
— Warlord Thokk Ironhide during da Blackroot Siege

## How We Lead

Ain't like dem fancy humans wit their shiny ranks and special words. We lead simple - da strongest leads, da next strongest follows, and everybody else better listen good or get crushed. Each leader's gotta prove they deserve their spot, every single day.
