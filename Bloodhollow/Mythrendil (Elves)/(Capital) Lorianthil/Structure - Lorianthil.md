### **Lorianthil – Structure and Layout**

_"Every branch a pathway, every leaf a sentinel. Our city does not impose upon nature—it persuades it."_  
— High Commander Aelindra Starweaver

Lorianthil represents the pinnacle of elven architectural achievement, where magic and nature intertwine to create a living fortress. The city exists in perfect harmony with the ancient silverleaf trees that form its foundation, each level rising higher into the canopy through a combination of natural growth and magical cultivation.

### **City Layout**

Lorianthil's structure follows a spiral pattern, ascending through three main tiers that wind upward through the massive silverleaf trees. Each tier serves distinct purposes while maintaining the seamless blend of military precision and natural beauty that characterizes elven design.

- **The Root Halls – The Foundation Tier**  
    The ground level and immediate subterranean areas serve as both the city's foundation and its first line of defense. Here, the massive roots of the silverleaf trees have been shaped into grand halls and training grounds. The Root Halls house the city's military barracks, armor forges, and the primary defensive installations that protect Lorianthil from ground-based threats.
    
- **The Heartwood – The Living Tier**  
    The middle elevation contains the bulk of the city's population and civil functions. Residences, markets, and public spaces weave through the massive trunks of the silverleaf trees. This tier exemplifies the elven mastery of living architecture, with buildings that seem to grow naturally from the trees themselves.
    
- **The Crown Spires – The Ascendant Tier**  
    The highest level of Lorianthil rises above the canopy, where the most important military and governmental functions take place. This tier houses the Moonspire Academy, the High Commander's chambers, and the central magical defenses of the city. The spires provide an unobstructed view of the surrounding territories while remaining nearly invisible from below.
