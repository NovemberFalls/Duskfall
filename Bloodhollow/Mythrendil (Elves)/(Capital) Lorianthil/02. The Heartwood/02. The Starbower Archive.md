### **The Starbower Archive – Keeper of Eternal Knowledge**

_"Some secrets are written in ink, others in starlight. We preserve both."_  
— Lorekeeper Aelar Starweave

**The Starbower Archive** stands as the intellectual heart of Lorianthil, where knowledge flows like water through channels of living wood. Unlike traditional libraries with their rigid shelves and static collections, the Archive grows and shifts with its contents, its chambers expanding to accommodate new knowledge while older sections spiral deeper into the heart of the great silverleaf tree that houses it.

The Archive's unique architecture allows books and scrolls to be stored within the living wood itself, protected by layers of natural and magical preservation. Crystalline growths serve as both illumination and catalog system, their light shifting to guide seekers to their desired texts. The very air hums with the residual magic of countless spells and enchantments preserved within its collections.

Since the civil war, the Archive has become a fortress of knowledge. Entire sections have been sealed behind layers of both magical and natural defenses, while others shift location constantly to prevent sensitive information from falling into corrupted hands. The woods themselves have developed an appetite for shadow magic, actively consuming any attempt at dark enchantment.
