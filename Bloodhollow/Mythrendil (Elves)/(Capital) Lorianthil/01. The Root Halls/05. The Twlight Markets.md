### **The Twilight Markets – Where Secrets Trade in Whispers**
_"Every shadow holds a story. Every story has its price."_  
— Shadowmerchant Lyria Duskweaver

**The Twilight Markets** occupy the outermost ring of the Root Halls, a sprawling bazaar where necessity meets secrecy. Unlike the open markets of the upper city, these trading grounds exist in a perpetual state of dusk, where merchants deal in military supplies, magical components, and information critical to Lorianthil's defense.

The market consists of a series of interconnected chambers grown within the root system, each space carefully warded to prevent eavesdropping. Magical lanterns cast ever-shifting shadows that serve both aesthetic and practical purposes—their patterns form a complex code that alerts merchants to potential threats or opportunities.

Since the civil war, the Twilight Markets have become increasingly vital as a source of intelligence. The merchants here don't just trade goods; they trade in whispers of Twilight Faction movements, signs of corruption, and warnings of impending attacks.
