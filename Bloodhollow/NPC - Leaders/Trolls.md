**Chieftain Drekka Longtooth**
- **City:** Gloomwood Hollow
- **Title:** High Warlord of the Shadowclad
- **Description:** A towering troll with skin as gnarled as the trees he commands, Drekka is as old as the forest itself. His eyes glow faintly in the dark, and his long teeth are sharpened into fangs that drip with venom from rituals of the wild gods.

- **Title:** Shaman-Queen of the Icefang Tribe
- **Description:** Brukka’s skin is deathly white, marred by deep blue sigils that pulse in the cold. She carries a staff of jagged ice that hums with latent power, calling storms at her whim. Brukka’s word is law within the Frostfang Den, and it is said she speaks to the spirits of the frozen dead, who guide her every decision. Her rule is cold and harsh, and dissent is met with the wrath of the frozen winds.

**Warchanter Groth Bonevoice**
- **City:** 
- **Title:** Caller of the Wild Chorus

**Bonegrinder Vashrak the Maw**
- **City:** 
- **Title:** Flesh-Eater of the Hollow

- **Backstory:** Vashrak hunts for the warband, leading vicious raids on neighboring territories. His hunger for flesh is legendary, and he believes that consuming the hearts of fallen foes grants him their strength. Even the trolls under his command fear his appetite, ensuring loyalty through terror and raw power.

**Doomseer Skolva the Broken**
- **City:** 
- **Title:** Prophet of the Cracked Glacier
- **Description:** Skolva’s body is twisted and hunched, with shattered tusks and broken horns. His skin is gray-blue with frostbite scars that never heal. He drags a heavy stone tablet behind him, etched with ancient and forbidden runes.
- **Backstory:** Cast from a rival tribe for his dark predictions, Skolva wandered FrostFang until Brukka embraced his visions. He foretells calamities and uses his magic to shatter enemies with cascading ice. His prophecies often spell doom, but none dare silence him, for his warnings have saved the Icefang from ruin more than once.

**Warden Grekka Stonehide**

- **Backstory:** Tarkosh’s role is to raze the land when necessary, wielding fire to scorch paths through rival territories.

**Rimecaller Yzra the Shard**
- **City:** 
- **Title:** Frostbound Huntmaster
