**Lord Commander Aldric Blackthorn**
- City: Emberfall
- **Title:** Supreme Leader of the Crimsonmarch
- **Alignment:** Lawful Neutral
- **Age:** 57
- **Appearance:**  
    Aldric is tall and broad-shouldered, his face scarred from decades of war. His dark hair is streaked with silver, and his cold, gray eyes reflect the weight of his rule. He is rarely seen without his crimson-edged plate armor, even within the High Keep.
- **Temperament:**  
    Stern, uncompromising, and fiercely pragmatic. Aldric leads with iron authority, believing that peace is the byproduct of relentless vigilance. Mercy is not weakness, but neither is it given freely.
- **History:**  
    A veteran of the Veilfire War, Aldric rose to power during the **[[0099-09-01 - Emberfall - The Blackroot Siege]]** and solidified his control after suppressing the **[[0099-03-10 - Emberfall - The Black Anvil Revolt]].** Under his rule, Emberfall’s influence expanded, though at the cost of growing unrest among the lower classes.
- **Rumors:**  
    It is whispered that Aldric’s warhammer, _“Oathbreaker,”_ is cursed, having shattered during the Siege of Blackroot. Some claim the cracks in the warhammer bleed during moonless nights.

- **Age:** 39
- **Appearance:**  
    Isolde stands tall and wiry, her presence commanding even in silence. Her sharp features mirror the tempered steel of the soldiers she leads. Her short-cropped, silver-streaked hair contrasts with the burnished **iron-plated armor** she maintains to a mirror sheen. Slung across her back is **"Hallowfang,"** a slender, double-edged longsword crafted in Grimhaldir and gifted to her following the **Battle of the Crimson Scar**. A silver emblem of **Tyr** dangles from her belt, worn and weathered by countless battles.
- **Temperament:**  
    Isolde exudes a cold, unwavering sense of duty. Though stern, her sense of fairness and camaraderie commands the loyalty of the Ironbound Guard. **She is merciless in battle** but tempered by compassion toward her soldiers. Those under her command often say, _"The fire in her heart burns colder than the steel in her hand."_
- **History:**  
    Rising from obscurity during the **Veilfire War,** Isolde’s tactical brilliance became apparent when she led a battalion of the **Ironbound Guard** to intercept and destroy **Krogan Bloodtusk’s** warbands during the **[[0100-01-15 - Emberfall - The Battle of the Crimson Scar]]**. Her calculated maneuvers along the **Sunfield Plains** shattered Krogan’s leadership, culminating in her **single-handed defeat of the warlord.** This earned her the title **"The Bastion’s Talon."**
- **Rumors:**  
    _“Her blade does not rust because the fire of the Crimson Scar still lingers upon it,”_ some whisper. Others claim **she drinks from the Veilfire-lit trenches at night, communing with the souls of the dead** to seek guidance. The most superstitious soldiers believe **Isolde speaks to the god Tyr beneath the light of the full moon,** offering prayers for the souls she has slain.
