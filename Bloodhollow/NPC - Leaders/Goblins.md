## Goblin Leadership

**Overboss Gribz Ironbelly**
- **City:** Smokestack Hollow
- **Title:** Foreman-King of the Smokeforge
- **Description:** Gribz is a squat, rotund goblin with soot-blackened skin and a belly armored with scrap metal plating. He lords over the factories of Smokestack Hollow from atop a rusted throne, directing legions of workers with a mix of threats and explosive demonstrations. His obsession with weaponry drives the goblin war machine, and those who fail to meet quotas often become test subjects for the latest unstable creations.

**Pyrelord Skrixx Blazebinder**
- **City:** Blazebolt
- **Title:** Firebrand of the Ashen Warrens
- **Description:** Skrixx is wiry and jittery, his hair permanently scorched and eyes bright with manic energy. His gauntlet, known as the Blazebinder’s Claw, ignites in his grasp, capable of launching torrents of flame. Skrixx is worshipped by his goblins not for his charisma, but for his ability to survive his own infernal experiments. In Blazebolt, he preaches fire as the path to dominance, and his followers are all too eager to burn anything in their way.

**Tinkerlord Vrozzle Snapgear**
- **City:** 
- **Title:** Master of Gears and Gizmos
- **Description:** Vrozzle is thin and spindly, his left arm fully mechanical, crafted from salvaged steel and enchanted clockwork. His goggles are permanently affixed to his face, and his robes are covered in spare gears and wires. Vrozzle's inventions often teeter between brilliance and catastrophic failure.
- **Backstory:** Vrozzle rose to prominence by creating the first mechanized war golem powered by captured lightning. Though it rampaged through half the city, the resulting destruction was enough to prove his genius. Now he oversees Smokestack Hollow’s war-machine assembly lines, where the motto is “If it doesn’t explode twice, it’s not done.”

**Bladewitch Nivka Sparkfang**
- **City:** 
- **Title:** Mistress of Blades and Alchemy
- **Description:** Nivka is lean and wiry, with jagged tattoos glowing faintly across her arms. She carries an assortment of serrated knives, all laced with venom or explosive powder. Her grin is full of sharp teeth, and she speaks in a sly whisper that unnerves even the bravest goblins.
- **Backstory:** Nivka rose through the ranks by sabotaging competitors with poisoned blades and rigged traps. Now she trains elite goblin assassins and alchemists, teaching them to blend stealth with volatile concoctions. Blazebolt’s most lethal tools are a direct product of her brutal ingenuity.

**Bigboss Rukz the Ironhide**
- **City:** 
- **Title:** Overlord of the Scrapfields
- **Description:** Towering over most goblins, Rukz’s skin is thick and mottled with scars. His crude iron armor is bolted directly into his flesh, and his club is fashioned from an engine block. Rukz is more brawn than brains, but few dare challenge his might.
- **Backstory:** Rukz smashed his way into power by literally crushing rival warlords. In Blazebolt, he controls the dangerous outer scrapfields where goblins scavenge for parts. His iron rule ensures that every ounce of metal is turned into either armor or weapons.

**Boomseer Klikka Fizzgrin**
- **City:** 
- **Title:** Oracle of the Blast Furnace
- **Description:** Klikka is thin and hunched, her robes covered in ash and bits of charred fabric. Her eyes twitch constantly, and her staff is tipped with a ticking, volatile orb that rattles when she speaks. She claims to foresee the future through the shape of explosions.
- **Backstory:** Klikka earned her title when one of her “visions” accidentally leveled an entire forge, resulting in the construction of an even larger factory. The goblins view her as half-mad, but her explosive predictions often lead to unexpected victories.

**Scrapboss Gromp Two-Toes**
- **City:** 
- **Title:** Chief Salvager of the Wastes
- **Description:** Gromp is squat, missing several fingers and toes from failed experiments. His leather vest is patched with scrap, and his goggles are cracked and smudged with oil. He carries a hooked staff used to pull valuable debris from scrapyards.
- **Backstory:** Gromp built his fortune reclaiming war debris and repurposing it into crude but effective weapons. His workshops produce countless war machines, many of which explode after a single use—just as planned.

**Warcaller Triz Gravenclaw**
- **City:** 
- **Title:** Chieftain of the Howling Warrens
- **Description:** Triz’s voice is deep and rasping, often amplified through a bone-horn war trumpet slung across his back. His scarred chest is bare save for a necklace of claws, and he carries a jagged spear crackling with unstable lightning.
- **Backstory:** Triz’s war cries can stir even the most cowardly goblins into battle frenzies. His ritualistic chants are believed to summon storms, though most result in thunderous explosions that devastate both friend and foe alike.

**Torchbearer Vrika the Black-Eyed**
- **City:** 
- **Title:** Keeper of the Eternal Flame
- **Description:** Vrika’s eyes are charred black, said to be from staring into the heart of Blazebolt’s great forge for too long. Her robes are perpetually singed, and she carries a scepter crowned with a molten crystal that never cools.
- **Backstory:** Vrika presides over the forges of Blazebolt, ensuring that the flames never die. She believes fire is sacred and oversees rituals that ignite both steel and spirits. Her devotion to flame has birthed devastating incendiary weapons.

**Chief Engineer Skrak Greasefingers**
- **City:** 
- **Title:** Master of War Engines
- **Description:** Skrak’s face is smeared with oil, and his hands are perpetually stained black with soot. He wears a crude mechanical exoskeleton to assist with heavy lifting and wields a wrench as tall as he is. His armor clanks with gears and bolts, often malfunctioning at the worst times.
- **Backstory:** Skrak’s war engines have transformed Smokestack Hollow into a fortress of grinding gears and belching smoke. Though his machines break down often, they leave trails of destruction in their wake. Skrak is notorious for testing his inventions personally, usually at the expense of several bystanders.
