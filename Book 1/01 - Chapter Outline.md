## Structure: ~30 chapters across 6 days + prologue and epilogue

## PROLOGUE: THE ANVIL (6 months before the siege)
**POV: Stoneveil**
**Setting:** The Anvil District, Emberfall -- Night of the Black Anvil Revolt

The book opens in fire. Stoneveil stands on the wall above the Anvil District, watching the firebombing he ordered consume the rebel smiths below. Forge-King Drelgar Blackhand dies standing over his forge. 900 people burn. Stoneveil watches until the screaming stops, then turns to give his next order.

*Purpose: Establish Stoneveil's moral weight. Establish tone. Tell the reader immediately: this is not a story with clean heroes.*

## PART ONE: THE GATHERING DARK (Day 1)

### Chapter 1 -- THE LAST GOOD MORNING
**POV: November Falls**
November and the healer in Emberfall. A quiet morning. She tends to patients at the Hall of the Fallen. He trains -- badly, earnestly -- in a yard nearby. They share a meal. She teases him about his swordwork. He tells her about the Creed. The world is hard but for the first time in years, November Falls has something worth waking up for.

*Purpose: Establish November and the healer's relationship. Make the reader love what he's about to lose. Ground the reader in the human scale before the war crushes it.*

### Chapter 2 -- THE HORIZON DARKENS
**POV: Thokk Ironhide**
Thokk surveys his army from the hills outside Emberfall. 2,500 warriors. Skrixx Blazebinder's goblin siege engines smoke and rattle beside them. Grimtusk da Bonechanter reads the bones -- the omens are unclear. Thokk commits anyway. He speaks to his War-Chiefs. This is not a raid. This is a war for survival. Two winters. That's how long the Ironclaw have before the hunting grounds fail.

*Purpose: Humanize the enemy immediately. The reader should understand Thokk's desperation before the first arrow flies.*

### Chapter 3 -- THE SUNDERED GATE
**POV: Stoneveil**
Stoneveil prepares the defenses. He walks the Iron Marches, inspects the gate, briefs his officers. Captain Isolde Veyne reports troop strength: 850 combat-ready. Stoneveil does the math in his head and says nothing. He speaks with Lord Commander Blackthorn via runner -- the Emberheart will not commit its reserves. Stoneveil is on his own.

*Purpose: Establish the tactical reality. Show the gap between what Stoneveil needs and what he has.*

### Chapter 4 -- THE FIRST THUNDER
**POV: November Falls**
The siege opens. Goblin siege engines launch. The blast hits near the Hall of the Fallen. November is thrown. Darkness. When he wakes, the world is smoke and screaming. He searches for her. Shouts her name. Finds nothing. Soldiers run past him -- he is invisible, a civilian, nobody's priority. The gates are closing. The siege has begun.

*Purpose: The inciting incident. Everything changes in a single concussive blast. The reader should feel the disorientation -- one moment love, the next moment chaos.*

### Chapter 5 -- THE PRAYER
**POV: Kael Veyne**
Kael performs rites of protection over the garrison. He blesses weapons in the Cathedral of Tyr's Judgment. He is calm, armored in faith. He walks the Inner Ring and sees the preparations -- the Ironbound Guard at the Garrison, the War-Mages at the Veilfire Spire. Everything is ordered. Everything is as Tyr wills. He prays. The silence that answers does not trouble him. Yet.

*Purpose: Establish faith as a pillar. Show it intact so the reader watches it crack.*

---

## PART TWO: FIRST BLOOD (Day 2)

### Chapter 6 -- THE WAVE
**POV: Stoneveil**
The first full assault. Orcs hit the Sundered Gate and the outer wall simultaneously. Stoneveil commands from the ramparts. The defenders hold -- barely. Casualty reports come in. Stoneveil adjusts. The machine works. But the numbers are wrong, and they're going to stay wrong.

### Chapter 7 -- THE BORROWED SWORD
**POV: November Falls**
November finds a composite unit forming near the gate. Soldiers who've lost their squads. He picks up a dead man's sword and falls in. No one asks if he's enlisted. No one cares. The orcs come. November fights for the first time in his life -- sloppy, terrified, desperate. He kills. He is hit. He goes down. He gets back up. The soldiers beside him -- trained, competent, faster, stronger -- note the civilian who won't leave the wall.

### Chapter 8 -- THE BONES SPEAK
**POV: Thokk Ironhide**
After the first assault, Thokk counts the dead. More than projected. Skrixx's siege engines broke through in two places but the goblins couldn't hold the breach. Grimtusk reads the bones again -- the spirits are restless but unclear. Thokk walks the orc camp, performs death rites for the fallen himself. He is not a tyrant. He is a father watching his children die for a future they may never see.

### Chapter 9 -- THE FIRST RITES
**POV: Kael Veyne**
The wounded flood the Hall of the Fallen. Kael moves between the infirmary and the walls, administering last rites. A soldier dies with Kael's prayer on his lips. The prayer didn't save him. Kael tells himself this is Tyr's will. The crack hasn't appeared yet. But the ground beneath his faith shifts, just slightly.

---

## PART THREE: THE GRIND (Day 3)

### Chapter 10 -- THE MATHEMATICS OF BLOOD
**POV: Stoneveil**
Day 3. The assault is relentless. Stoneveil manages rotations, repairs, supplies. He makes triage decisions -- who gets medicine, who gets food, who goes back to the wall. Every choice is correct. Every choice kills someone. He eats standing up, sword still in hand. He hasn't slept.

### Chapter 11 -- THE COMPASS
**POV: November Falls**
November checks in with himself. The inner compass. He's bruised, cut, exhausted. The soldiers in his unit have accepted him -- not as a fighter, but as a presence. He's the man who carries water to the wall when the fighting stops. Who helps drag the wounded to the medics. Who stands his shift and someone else's because he only needs five hours of sleep and everyone else needs eight. He is useful. That is enough.

### Chapter 12 -- THE PRICE OF FEEDING
**POV: Thokk Ironhide**
Thokk discusses strategy with his War-Chiefs. The siege is costing more than anticipated. Supplies are stretched. Skrixx demands more resources for his engines. Thokk must balance goblin demands, orc casualties, and the dwindling timeline. He sees Emberfall's defenders fight with a desperation he recognizes -- and that recognition unsettles him.

### Chapter 13 -- THE SILENCE
**POV: Kael Veyne**
Kael prays at the Cathedral. The silence that answers is louder than before. He watches High Inquisitor Varian Marrow sentence a deserter to death. Marrow's faith is absolute and cruel. Kael sees his own future in that cruelty and recoils. But what is the alternative? Doubt?

---

## PART FOUR: THE BREAK (Day 4)

### Chapter 14 -- THE OUTER RING FALLS
**POV: Stoneveil**
The Ironclaw breach the outer ring's flanks. The Sundered Gate holds but the Iron Marches are overrun. Stoneveil orders the retreat to the Anvil -- the middle ring. He leaves wounded behind. He does not look back. This is the correct decision. That is the worst thing about it.

### Chapter 15 -- THE RETREAT
**POV: November Falls**
November's unit falls back through the Iron Marches. He sees the district being overrun -- orcs flooding through breaches, fighting in the streets, the buildings he walked past this morning becoming slaughterhouses. He carries a wounded soldier who is heavier than him and slower than the retreat. Someone tells him to leave the man. November does not leave the man.

### Chapter 16 -- INSIDE THE WALLS
**POV: Thokk Ironhide**
Thokk walks through the conquered outer ring. Orc dead everywhere. Human dead too. He stands in the Sundered Gate -- the gate that never fell -- and looks inward at the Anvil District, the next line of defense. He knows Stoneveil is in there, reorganizing, preparing. Thokk respects this. It makes what comes next worse.

### Chapter 17 -- THE CRACKING
**POV: Kael Veyne**
Kael watches the outer ring refugees flood into the middle ring. Children. Wounded. The dying. He blesses them. His blessings do nothing. A woman asks him why Tyr allows this. He gives the answer he was trained to give. He hears how hollow it sounds. For the first time, he wonders if she's right to ask.

---

## PART FIVE: THE ANVIL (Day 5)

### Chapter 18 -- THE GHOST DISTRICT
**POV: Stoneveil**
Stoneveil establishes defense lines in the Anvil District -- the same district he firebombed six months ago. The ruins of the Black Anvil Revolt are his barricades now. He uses the burned-out shell of Drelgar Blackhand's forge as a command post. He stands in the exact spot where the Forge-King died. The symmetry is not lost on him.

### Chapter 19 -- STREET BY STREET
**POV: November Falls**
Street fighting in the Anvil. November's unit is fragmented. He fights alongside strangers in ruins he doesn't recognize. His sword breaks. He picks up another. A trained soldier beside him -- faster, stronger, better -- takes a spear through the throat. November pulls him behind a wall and holds him while he dies. The man is the third person November has watched die today. He checks the compass. Still standing. Still fighting. That has to be enough.

**[DECISION POINT: Context for the author. November is in the ruins, exhausted, bleeding from a cut above his eye. His unit has been scattered. He can hear fighting ahead -- a small group of defenders is being overwhelmed. He can also hear civilians behind him -- families trapped in a collapsed building, calling for help. He cannot do both. Which way does November go?]**

### Chapter 20 -- THE SPIRITS GROW QUIET
**POV: Thokk Ironhide**
Thokk presses into the Anvil District. The street fighting is brutal -- worse than the walls. His warriors are dying in alleys and chokepoints. Grimtusk tells him the spirits have gone quiet. The bones won't speak. Thokk doesn't know if this means victory or doom. He pushes forward because there is no backward.

### Chapter 21 -- THE BREAKING POINT
**POV: Kael Veyne**
Kael is pulled from the Cathedral to the front lines. The wounded need blessings. The dying need rites. He walks through the Anvil and sees a version of hell that scripture never prepared him for. He tries to heal a child. His prayer fails. The child dies. Kael's faith does not break. It *fractures* -- a crack that runs deep but hasn't yet reached the surface.

---

## PART SIX: THE SEVENTH STRIKE (Day 6)

### Chapter 22 -- THE LAST WALL
**POV: Stoneveil**
Dawn. Stoneveil counts his remaining forces. The number is catastrophic. He sends a final report to Blackthorn in the Emberheart. No reserves are coming. The Anvil is all there is. He addresses the survivors. Not a speech. A fact: they hold here or they die. There is no third option.

### Chapter 23 -- THE MAN WHO WOULD NOT LEAVE
**POV: November Falls**
The final assault begins. November is at a barricade in the Anvil with what's left of his scratch unit. Orcs pour through. He fights. He is hit. He goes down. He gets back up. He is hit again. He gets back up again. The soldiers around him -- the ones who are better than him, faster, stronger -- they follow his lead. Not because he's commanding them. Because in the hell of Day 6, the man who keeps standing becomes magnetic. People gravitate to the thing that won't break.

### Chapter 24 -- THE GATE
**POV: Thokk Ironhide**
Thokk leads the breach into the middle ring. This is the final push. He can feel it -- the balance tipping. Emberfall is breaking. His warriors surge forward. Thokk is at the front because that is where Warlords belong. He is looking for the commander. He is looking for the end.

### Chapter 25 -- THE SEVENTH STRIKE
**POV: Stoneveil**
Stoneveil meets Thokk at the breach point. Two leaders. Two men who have spent everything they have. The fight is not elegant. It is two exhausted warriors trying to kill each other in the ruins of a city that has already died. Seven strikes. On the seventh, Stoneveil's blade finds Thokk's throat.

Thokk falls. He dies standing, as the old ways demand.

The orc assault breaks. Not from defeat -- from the loss of their leader. The warbands fragment. The retreat begins.

### Chapter 26 -- THE SILENCE AFTER
**POV: November Falls**
The fighting stops. November stands in the wreckage. 72 survivors. The smoke clears slowly. He searches for her again -- through the rubble, the dead, the wounded. She is not there. She is not among the survivors. She is not among the dead.

She is gone.

November checks the compass. He is standing. He is alive. He kept the Creed. He did not abandon anyone.

But she is gone.

---

## EPILOGUE

### Chapter 27 -- THE CONSCRIPTION
**POV: November Falls**
Days later. The survivors are being processed. The military is rebuilding. An officer approaches November -- the civilian who fought on the wall for six days without rank or order. He is told, not asked, that he is now a soldier of the Emberfall Legion.

November puts on the armor. Takes the oath. Not for the empire. For the reach it gives him. Somewhere out there, she is alive. He has to believe that. And if the only road to finding her runs through the machine of war, then he will walk it.

The Creed survives. November Falls walks forward.

### Chapter 28 -- THE SKULL
**POV: Stoneveil** (short)
Stoneveil stands in the wreckage of the Sundered Gate. 72 survivors. He should feel victory. He feels nothing. The Anvil burned twice under his watch. The outer ring is rubble. The dead outnumber the living. He looks at his hands and sees the blood that won't wash off -- not from the siege, but from the revolt. From the firebombing. From the thousand small cruelties that "necessity" demanded.

He reports to Lord Commander Blackthorn. The city held. The cost was everything.

*Final image: Stoneveil alone in the ruins, the silence after war, and the question he can't answer -- was it worth it?*
