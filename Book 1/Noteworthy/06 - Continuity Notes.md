## STATUS: OVERALL ASSESSMENT

The manuscript is remarkably consistent across 29 chapters. Character names, the 6-day timeline, POV assignments, location geography, and the core emotional beats all track correctly. The issues identified below are minor arithmetic errors and a small number of continuity gaps -- none are structural.

---

## SECTION 1: CONTINUITY ERRORS (FIXES NEEDED)

### 1.1 Chapter 6 -- Garrison Arithmetic Error (MODERATE)

**Location:** Ch 6 "The Wave," line 127

**The Problem:** Stoneveil's internal math doesn't add up.
- The text states: "Twenty-seven from eight hundred and fifty left eight hundred and twenty-three. Nineteen returning from the wounded brought it to eight hundred and forty-two effective. The six criticals would be dead by evening, which brought the net to eight hundred and seventeen."
- 842 - 6 = **836**, not 817. The text says 817.
- This 817 figure is then repeated at line 135: "the defender had eight hundred and seventeen."

**Fix Options:**
- A) Change the math to produce 817: adjust wounded/returning numbers (e.g., 850 - 27 dead = 823; 823 - 6 criticals = 817; remove the "nineteen returning" line or make it clear they were already counted)
- B) Change "eight hundred and seventeen" to "eight hundred and thirty-six" in both places (lines 127, 135)
- C) Reinterpret: the 19 returning wounded were already counted in the 850 (i.e., they were briefly pulled off the line but are returning to duty, not additional bodies). In this reading: 850 - 27 dead - 6 criticals = 817 effective. The "nineteen returning" is informational, not additive. If this interpretation is intended, the sentence structure should be clarified.

**Recommendation:** Option C is the most elegant -- clarify the sentence to make clear the 19 are returning to their positions within the existing 850, not additions.

---

### 1.2 Chapter 28 -- Stoneveil's Duel Wound Missing (MINOR)

**Location:** Ch 28 "The Skull" (entire chapter)

**The Problem:** In Ch 25 "The Seventh Strike," Stoneveil takes a significant axe cut to his left upper arm during the duel with Thokk (edge through fabric, mail, and muscle; significant blood loss; arm loses function above the shoulder). Three days later in Ch 28, this wound is not mentioned. The chapter focuses entirely on the pre-existing left hand tremor (which started Day 3), but the fresh axe wound should still be healing and painful.

**Fix:** Add a brief reference to the bandaged/healing left arm wound in Ch 28, either when Stoneveil examines his hands or when the left hand tremor is described. A single sentence noting the stitched wound beneath the bandage would suffice.

---

### 1.3 Chapter 16 / Chapter 20 -- Ironclaw Casualty Count Ambiguity (MINOR)

**Location:** Ch 16 "Inside the Walls," line 237; Ch 20 "The Spirits Grow Quiet"

**The Problem:** Ch 16 states "Two hundred and eight Ironclaw dead in four days" and then closes with a total of "Two hundred and forty-nine dead." Ch 20 then says "Two hundred and ninety-three" as the running Ironclaw total (249 + 44 from Day 5).

The ambiguity: does "249" in Ch 16 include goblins (208 Ironclaw + ~41 goblins = 249)? Or is 249 the Ironclaw-only count (updated from 208 by end of day)?

If 249 includes goblins, then the Ironclaw count at end of Day 4 is 208, and the Ch 20 total should be 208 + 44 = 252, not 293. If 249 is Ironclaw-only, then 293 is correct.

**Fix:** Clarify in Ch 16 whether the 249 count is Ironclaw-only or combined forces. A phrase like "Two hundred and forty-nine Ironclaw dead" or "Two hundred and forty-nine dead across all warbands" would resolve it.

---

### 1.4 Chapter 26 vs Chapter 28 -- Dead Count (411 vs 778) (MINOR)

**Location:** Ch 26 "The Silence After" (Veyne counts 411 dead); Ch 28 "The Skull" (850 - 72 = 778 total lost)

**The Problem:** These numbers are not contradictory -- 411 is likely the count of recovered bodies in the Anvil District on Day 6, while 778 is the total lost across all six days (including those under rubble, in the outer ring, or dying later). However, the gap (367 unaccounted) is large and never explained.

**Fix:** Not strictly needed, but a line in Ch 28's report acknowledging that many bodies remain unrecoverable in the outer ring or under rubble would bridge the gap between Veyne's field count and the final total.

---

## SECTION 2: CONTINUITY OBSERVATIONS (NO FIX NEEDED)

### 2.1 Firebombing Death Count: Consistent
- Prologue: 912 confirmed dead (exact count), 43 under sixteen
- Line 209 (Prologue): "nine hundred people" (runner's rounded perception in the moment -- not an error)
- Ch 18: "nine hundred and twelve" (Stoneveil's precise recall from reports)
- Ch 28: "nine hundred and twelve" (after-action report)
- PRD says "900 people burn" -- this is a round number in the planning doc; the prose correctly uses 912

### 2.2 The Number 43: Deliberate Motif
The number 43 appears throughout as a clear thematic echo:
- Prologue: 43 children under 16 killed in the firebombing
- Ch 5: 43 weapons blessed by Kael
- Ch 6: 43 orc dead counted in the Veil's Throat
- Ch 17: 43 children counted passing through the gate (Kael)
- Ch 18: Arrows at 43%
- Ch 21: 43 wounded blessed by Kael
This is intentional and effective. No fix needed.

### 2.3 Veyne Family Connection: Consistent but Implicit
- Kael Veyne (Inquisitor) has "a sister who married a blacksmith"
- Captain Isolde Veyne (Stoneveil's adjutant) shares the surname
- Edric Thane is Kael's nephew (confirmed)
- If Isolde is Kael's sister, then Edric is Isolde's son, and Isolde watches her own son fight from the command post. She would have kept her maiden name professionally.
- This connection is never stated explicitly in the text. It creates powerful dramatic irony. Whether to make it explicit is an author decision.

### 2.4 Pell's Age: Internally Resolved
- Ch 23: November estimates Pell at "fifteen"
- Ch 27: Corrected to 14 ("younger than November had estimated")
- The text self-corrects. No fix needed.

### 2.5 Edric's Reunion with November (Ch 19 to Ch 21)
- Ch 19: Edric and November separated by a collapsing wall; November sends Edric south
- Ch 21: Kael finds Edric resting beside November behind the barricade
- The reunion happens offscreen. This is fine narratively -- the siege doesn't need every movement tracked -- but worth noting for awareness.

### 2.6 Rath's Fate: Implicitly Confirmed
- Ch 15: Rath holds an intersection with 3 Legionnaires as a rearguard
- Ch 16: Gharza reports 4 men killed 9 orcs before being overwhelmed (same intersection, orc POV)
- Rath is never explicitly confirmed dead from the human side. His composite unit fragments in Ch 19. This is effective -- the reader infers his death from the orc POV chapter.

---

## SECTION 3: THE DEFENDER'S CREED -- CONSISTENT

The Creed text is consistent throughout:

> *We do not cheat. We do not lie. We do not abandon.*

Full version appears in Ch 1 and Ch 27. The single line "We do not abandon" is used as a refrain in Ch 4, 15, 19, 23, 26, and 27. No variations or contradictions.

## SECTION 6: FORESHADOWING VERIFICATION

Per `Noteworthy/03 - Foreshadowing and Seeds.md`, the following threads should be planted:

| Elven civil war mentioned in passing | YES | YES | Multiple references to elves and Mythrendil across chapters; Twilight Faction mentioned |
| November's brother referenced | YES | YES | Ch 26 ("the brother who was presumed dead") |
| Undead in the north mentioned | YES | YES | Revenants extensively developed in Ch 2, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24; Grimtusk references "da rot in da north" / Veilfire corruption |
| Skrixx survives and escapes | YES | YES | Ch 25 (destroys engines, withdraws north with 46 goblins); Ch 28 (noted in after-action report as "at large") |
| Veilfire Spire glows during battle | YES | YES | Ch 3 (coordination), Ch 5 (green-blue flames, brighter than usual), Ch 10 ("brighter than yesterday") |
