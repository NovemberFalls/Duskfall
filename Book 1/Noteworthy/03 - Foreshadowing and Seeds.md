# The Seventh Strike -- Foreshadowing and Seeds
## Threads planted in Book 1 that pay off in later books

---

### FOR BOOK 2 (The Battle of the Crimson Scar)
- **Captain Isolde Veyne** appears as a competent officer under Stoneveil's command. She survives the siege. Readers should note her capability without realizing she'll be the protagonist of the next major battle.
- **November's conscription** into the Emberfall Legion. His military training begins. By Book 2, he'll be a raw but official soldier.
- **The broken orc horde** -- after Thokk's death, the Ironclaw fragment. This sets up the remnant force under Krogan Bloodtusk that attacks three months later.

### FOR BOOK 3 (The Night of Falling Stars -- Elven POV)
- **A passing reference** to the elven civil war. A soldier mentions that the elves are fighting themselves. A war-mage comments that the Twilight Faction is spreading.
- **The timing:** The Night of Falling Stars happens in November of Year 99 -- roughly two months after the Blackroot Siege. The two events are happening in the same world, close in time.

### FOR THE SERIES ARC
- **November's missing healer** -- the central mystery/quest that drives the entire series. Book 1 establishes the loss. Future books drive the search.
- **November's brother** -- presumed dead, location unknown. A thread left dangling. Could surface in any future book.
- **The undead in the north** -- a reference or two. A scout report mentioning movement in the tar-like terrain near the coast. Necrobyss. The next threat after the Veilfire War ends.
- **The planar rifts** -- mentioned in passing. The world is breaking. Rifts between worlds widen with every failed ritual. This is the long-game existential threat.
- **The silence of the gods** -- Kael's fractured faith asks the central metaphysical question of the series: why did the gods leave? What broke the world's connection to the divine? This pays off over many books.
- **November's Creed** -- introduced as a personal code. Over the series, it grows. Others adopt it. It becomes something larger than one man. But in Book 1, it is fragile and small and entirely his.

### BURIED DETAILS
- **A soldier mentions Stonehaven** -- the mining town that was besieged in Year 92. Readers who come back to Book 1 after reading about Stonehaven will recognize the reference.
- **Dwarven-forged weapons** outperform human-forged ones. A small detail that hints at the Grimhaldir alliance and its importance.
- **Skrixx Blazebinder survives the siege** (or doesn't -- decision point). If he survives, he's a recurring antagonist. If he dies, his goblin siege technology legacy matters.
- **The Veilfire Spire glows** during the battle. Something in the spire responds to the violence. Archmage Selene Raventhorne is doing something in there. We don't learn what in Book 1.
