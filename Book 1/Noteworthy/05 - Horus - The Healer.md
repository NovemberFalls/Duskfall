## WHO SHE IS

**Name:** Horus (no surname given; she goes by Horus)
**Occupation:** Healer at the Hall of the Fallen, Emberfall
**Build:** Lean, practical, built for long shifts and heavy lifting. Not delicate. The hands of a woman who has set bones, stitched wounds, and held dying men steady while they screamed. Calloused palms. Steady fingers. She carries herself like someone who has already seen the worst thing today and chose to keep working.
**Eyes:** Dark -- warm when she lets them be, clinical when the work demands it. She looks at people the way a carpenter looks at a broken chair: not with pity, but with the quiet certainty that it can be fixed.

Horus works among the war-wounded and the war-dead. The Hall of the Fallen is not a hospital in any gentle sense -- it is the place Emberfall sends the bodies that still breathe and the ones that don't, and Horus moves between them with the same calm attention. She cleans wounds that will heal and closes the eyes of men who won't. She has done this long enough that the difference between the two does not shake her. What shakes her is indifference -- the city's willingness to produce the wounded and forget them.

She chose this. Not by assignment, not by obligation. She walked into the Hall of the Fallen and stayed because someone had to, and she decided that someone would be her. Every morning, the same choice. Every morning, she makes it again.

## WHO SHE IS TO NOVEMBER

She did not save November Falls. He saved himself. But she was the first person in years who looked at him -- broken nose, cracked ribs, blood and bad ale on his breath -- and did not look away. Not with pity. Not with disgust. With patience. The steady, infuriating patience of a woman who has watched men die and knows the difference between someone who is finished and someone who hasn't started yet.

She saw the second thing. He hated her for it at first -- hated the way she didn't flinch, the way she changed his bandages like he was worth the effort, the way she talked to him like a man and not a cautionary tale. It took weeks before he understood that she wasn't performing kindness. She simply refused to agree with his assessment of himself.

She teases him. About his swordwork, about his Creed, about the way he eats too fast and sleeps too little. It is not cruelty -- it is the language of someone who has decided you are real, that you can take it, that you deserve honesty instead of comfort. When she laughs at him, he feels seen. When she corrects his grip on a bandage, her fingers over his, the world is small enough to survive.

## WHAT THE READER NEEDS IN CHAPTER 1

The reader must love Horus in specifics, not abstractions. Not "she was kind" -- the way she blows a strand of hair out of her face while elbow-deep in someone's wound. Not "she cared for him" -- the way she saves him the heel of the bread because she knows he likes it and will never ask. Not "they were happy" -- the silence between them that doesn't need filling, the morning light through the Hall's narrow windows, two people eating together who have both been alone long enough to know what this is worth.

She is not perfect. She is tired. She is sharp when she's tired, and she is tired most of the time. She does not ask about his day because she already knows -- he trained, he failed, he got back up, he'll do it again tomorrow. She respects the repetition because she lives it herself. Every morning, the same Hall, the same wounds, the same choice to keep stitching.

The reader falls in love with Horus the way November did: not all at once, but in the accumulation of small, specific, irreplaceable details. The kind of details that make her absence, when it comes, feel like a limb torn away.
