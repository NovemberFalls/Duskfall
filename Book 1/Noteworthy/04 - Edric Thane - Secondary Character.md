# EDRIC THANE -- Secondary Character Profile
## The Cost of War Made Personal

## WHO HE IS

**Name:** Legionnaire Edric Thane
**Age:** 19
**Rank:** Legionnaire, Emberfall Legion (gate garrison)
**Build:** Wiry, not yet grown into his shoulders. The body of a boy pretending to be a man. Fast hands -- a blacksmith's son who grew up gripping a hammer before he ever gripped a sword.
**Eyes:** Brown, too wide for the walls. The kind that haven't learned to stop looking at the dead.

Edric Thane is nineteen years old and already carrying a dead man's weight. His father was a blacksmith in the Anvil District -- one of the 900 who burned when Warden Stoneveil firebombed the Black Anvil Revolt. The pension came, thin and formal, stamped with the seal of the empire that killed his father. It wasn't enough. It was never going to be enough. So Edric enlisted, because a soldier's wage feeds a family and a blacksmith's orphan has no forge to inherit -- not anymore. Just a patch of scorched earth where the anvil used to ring.

He is Kael Veyne's nephew. Kael -- his mother's brother -- pulled strings to get Edric assigned to the gate garrison, believing that proximity to the Warden's command would forge the boy into steel. It is the kind of well-meaning decision that haunts a man forever. Kael wanted to protect him by making him stronger. The siege will make that logic obscene.

## WHO HE IS TO THE READER

Edric is the reader's heart walking around in a legionnaire's armor. He is afraid -- openly, honestly afraid -- in a way the other POV characters can't afford to be. Stoneveil has walled his fear behind discipline. Thokk has buried his beneath duty. November has transmuted his into stubbornness. But Edric is nineteen. He hasn't learned those tricks yet. His fear is right there on the surface, and he fights anyway.

That is what wins the reader's heart: not bravery, but *willingness*. He shakes before every assault. His hands tremble when he checks his sword. He talks too much when he's scared -- fills the silence with questions, observations, half-jokes that die in the smoke. But when the orcs come over the wall, Edric Thane stands his ground. Every time. Not because he's fearless. Because he decided that standing is what soldiers do, and he is trying so hard to be a soldier.

He latches onto November the way a younger brother latches onto an older one. Not because November is skilled -- Edric is the better fighter by training -- but because November is *steady*. In the chaos of the composite unit, the civilian who won't leave becomes an anchor. Edric doesn't follow November's sword. He follows November's conviction.

## THE MOMENT HE WINS THE READER

Chapter 11, Day 3. The grinding. Everyone is exhausted, hollow-eyed, running on fumes. Edric sits beside November during a lull and says something small -- something about his father's forge, about the sound an anvil makes when you strike it right, about how he used to fall asleep to that sound as a boy. It is not a speech. It is a nineteen-year-old kid remembering a world that doesn't exist anymore. The reader should feel their chest tighten. This is a boy who should be apprenticing at his father's forge, not bleeding on a wall. The war took one life from him already. It is about to take the only one he has left.

## HOW HE DIES

Day 6. Chapter 23. The Man Who Would Not Leave.

The final assault. November's barricade in the Anvil District. Orcs pouring through the breach. Edric is beside November -- where he's been for five days, where he chose to be. The fighting is the worst it has ever been. November goes down. Edric pulls him back. November gets up. They fight. Shoulder to shoulder, the civilian and the legionnaire, in the ruins of the district that already took Edric's father.

Edric takes a wound -- bad, but he stays up. He keeps fighting. Then a second blow, and his legs give. November catches him. Drags him behind the barricade. Holds him.

Edric does not die with a speech. He does not die with last words that tie everything together in a neat bow. He dies the way nineteen-year-olds die in sieges: too fast, too afraid, reaching for someone's hand. November holds that hand. The Creed says *we do not abandon*. November does not abandon.

His death is not a plot device. It is a price. The war machine fed Edric Thane into its teeth -- the son of a man it already killed -- and ground him down to nothing. The reader should feel it like a fist in the sternum: not the grand tragedy of a hero falling, but the small, specific, unbearable tragedy of a boy who never got to grow up.

Kael Veyne will learn of his nephew's death. He will perform the rites. And in that moment, the question of whether faith survived the siege will have its answer written in the silence between a prayer and a dead boy's face.

## WHAT HE MEANS TO THE STORY

Edric is Theme #4: Innocence as Currency. He is what the war machine consumes. His arc -- from frightened recruit to November's companion to a body cooling behind a barricade -- is the cost of war distilled to a single life. The reader must love him so that losing him leaves a wound that doesn't close.

He also bridges two POV characters. Through Edric, Kael's private war between faith and reality becomes personal. Through Edric, Stoneveil's firebombing of the Anvil gains a face -- the son of a man who burned. Edric connects the moral threads of the book without ever knowing he's doing it. He is just a boy trying to survive. That he doesn't is the point.
