## The Story

The Blackroot Siege is the bloodiest engagement of the Veilfire War's final years. Warlord Thokk Ironhide of the Ironclaw orcs, allied with Pyrelord Skrixx Blazebinder's goblin war-engineers, brings 2,500+ warriors against Emberfall's outer defenses. 850 defenders hold the walls.

Six days later, 72 survive.

The novel follows four POV characters through the siege:

1. **November Falls** -- A 27-year-old civilian with no rank and a borrowed sword. He lost his family to the war, nearly lost himself to the bottle, and was pulled back by a healer named [TBD] at the Hall of the Fallen. When the siege opens, a goblin blast separates them. He fights not for the empire, not for glory, but because the walls are between him and the woman he loves -- and because his code demands he stand. He is outclassed by every soldier around him. He does not quit.

2. **Warden Alric Stoneveil** -- The commander of the Sundered Gate. A 52-year-old career soldier who firebombed his own industrial district six months earlier to crush a rebellion. He is competent, haunted, and willing to cross every line necessary to hold the city. The siege forces him to answer the question: what is left of a man who has burned away everything but duty?

3. **Warlord Thokk Ironhide** -- The enemy who is not a villain. Leader of the Ironclaw orcs, fighting not for conquest but for survival. His people will starve within two winters without new territory. The siege is a desperate gamble by a leader who knows the cost and pays it anyway.

4. **Inquisitor Adept Kael Veyne** -- A devout servant of Tyr whose faith is tested by the siege's brutality. His prayers don't heal. His blessings don't protect. The gods are silent. What remains when belief meets reality?

## What the Reader Should Feel

- **Constriction.** The world gets smaller with every chapter. The walls close in.
- **Weight.** Every death matters. Every decision has a cost. Nothing is free.
- **Moral vertigo.** The reader should never be comfortable choosing a side.
- **Devastation.** The ending is not a victory. It is survival purchased in blood.
- **Investment.** The reader closes the book and wants to know what happens to November Falls. Not from a cliffhanger -- from love.

## Series Setup

Book 1 is self-contained. The siege begins and ends. But November Falls walks out of it conscripted into the Emberfall Legion, searching for the woman who was taken from him. That search will carry him across Bloodhollow -- into orc lands, elven forests, goblin warrens, and the undead-haunted north -- making him the reader's eyes across the entire world of Duskfall.

He is our Drizzt. The man who carries the series.
