# CHAPTER TWO: THE HORIZON DARKENS

## Day 1 — Before the Siege

---

The city burned even when it wasn't burning.

Thokk stood on the ridge and watched Emberfall breathe smoke into the sky. Forge-smoke — thick, greasy, rising from the middle ring at all hours because the humans never stopped making things. Swords. Shields. Nails. Chains. A people who had decided the answer to every question was iron.

He understood that.

The ridge gave him everything he needed. Emberfall sat in the valley's crook like a fist of blackened stone — three rings stacked tight, the inner keep rising above both walls like a broken tooth. The Sundered Gate faced north, dark iron set between bastions that leaned inward as if the years had bent them. Rune-wards crawled across its surface, faintly luminous, the old dwarven work the humans maintained but no longer understood.

Thokk had studied it for three days. The gate was strong. The walls behind it were not.

The eastern section had been patched twice — different stone, different mortar, seams visible from the ridge. Someone had come through there before. The western flank was worse. The wall dipped where old mining tunnels ran beneath it, the ground soft, the foundations settling. Skrixx had seen it before Thokk had, which was the only reason the goblin was still breathing.

Thokk turned from the city and looked at what he'd brought to kill it.

---

Twenty-five hundred.

Twelve hundred Ironclaw — his blood, the warriors who'd followed him from Bloodtide Bay through three seasons of hard march and harder choices. They squatted around cook fires, sharpened blades on river stones, checked armour straps with the methodical patience of people who knew a loose buckle was as deadly as a sword. They were what the Ironclaw had left to bet on a future they might not see.

Eight hundred goblins, swarming over their machines in the flats. They moved like insects — bursts of frantic motion, sudden stillness, then motion again. The siege engines squatted like wounded animals: catapults lashed from timber and chain, cradles packed with clay pots of alchemist's fire stored in holes because even goblins knew better than to keep the stuff above ground. The largest — the Jawbreaker, though it had been called four other things this week — was a trebuchet the size of a barn. It creaked when the wind blew. Thokk did not trust anything that needed rebuilding after every third shot.

But Skrixx's machines had broken walls before. Ugly, unreliable, and effective. Three qualities Thokk could work with.

The fifth hundred stood apart. They always stood apart. The Revenants — Bane's Kissed, the dead things that had crawled out of the northern bogs after the corruption spread. They did not eat. They did not speak. They waited at the camp's edge with grey skin and hollow eyes and weapons older than anything alive.

Thokk did not like them. He used them because the math did not allow otherwise.

The math did not allow much of anything, these days.

---

"Da bones are quiet."

Grimtusk said it the way he said everything — flat, the words dropping like stones into still water. He squatted beside the fire pit, hands hovering over the scatter of wolf knuckles he'd cast into the ash. The traditional casting for a war-reading.

Thokk stood over him and waited.

Grimtusk was old. Past sixty — ancient by orcish measure, a feat of stubbornness and spiritual power that had kept him alive through wars that killed younger, stronger shamans. His body was a map of survival: ritual scars covering his arms and chest in patterns that told the story of every battle he'd blessed, every warrior he'd sent into the ground. His tusks were capped with copper, the mark of a High War-Shaman. His eyes were the milky grey of a man who saw things that existed in places where colour did not apply.

He picked up a bone. Turned it. Set it down.

"Quiet how?"

"Not silent. Quiet." He traced a line in the ash with one thick finger. "Da spirits are dere. I feel dem. But dey don't speak clear. Dey shift. Like smoke in wind — present, but ya can't hold it."

"Victory or defeat?"

"Neither. Both." Grimtusk looked up. "Da bones show blood. Dey always show blood before a siege. But da pattern is wrong. Da blood don't flow one way. It flows everywhere. Like da ground is drinking it."

Thokk said nothing.

"I can bless da weapons. I can mark da warriors. Da rites will hold. But da world beneath dem is changing. Da old connections — da lines between us and da ancestors — dey're thinning. Like roots in bad soil."

"Can ya still bless da warbands?"

"Yes."

"Can ya still read da dead after da fighting?"

"Yes."

"Den dat's enough."

Grimtusk watched him for a long moment. Then nodded — a single dip of his heavy head, the motion of a shaman accepting a warlord's decision because that was the order of things, even when the bones said the order of things was changing.

"I'll prepare da rites for dawn."

"Before dawn. Da assault starts at first light."

He rose. He moved slowly — not from weakness, but from the deliberate care of a man who carried more weight than his body and understood that rushing was the privilege of people who hadn't learned what haste could cost.

He stopped at the edge of the firelight.

"Dere is one more thing. Da bones showed a number. Seven." He turned the word over. "Seven strikes. Da spirits wouldn't say what it means."

He walked into the dark. Thokk watched him go.

Seven.

The number meant nothing to him. Not yet.

---

The War-Chiefs came at dusk. Four of them, around the fire, because that was where decisions lived.

Krogan Bloodtusk, eastern assault, three hundred strong. He'd fought beside Thokk at Stonehaven when they were young enough to believe winning a battle meant something beyond surviving it. Gharza Splitjaw, western warband, two hundred and fifty. The only orc in the host who argued with Thokk to his face — a quality he tolerated because she was usually right. Urzag the Quiet, reserve and war-beasts. He had not spoken more than twenty words in any council Thokk had attended. And Malga Bonefist, vanguard — the warriors who went first, hit the wall first, died fastest and knew it.

Thokk stood. The War-Chiefs sat. This was the way.

"Tomorrow," Thokk said.

No one spoke. They had marched for three months. They had watched the city from these hills for three days. They knew what tomorrow meant.

"Da Jawbreaker and da smaller engines hit da gate and da eastern flank at first light. Skrixx's sappers go in under da western wall while da bombardment holds their eyes. Krogan takes da eastern approach. Gharza takes da west. Malga, yer vanguard hits da gate itself."

Malga nodded. Broad, scarred, her left ear gone from a fight she'd won at sixteen. She had led the vanguard at four sieges. She would lead it at this one. If the gate took her, another would step up. That was the way.

"Da Revenants?" Krogan asked. His voice was deep — deeper than Thokk's, which was rare. He spoke the way old trees fell: slowly, with inevitability.

"Reserve. Dey go in when da wall breaks. Not before."

"And if da wall don't break?"

"It'll break."

Gharza leaned forward. The firelight caught the split in her jaw — the scar that ran from chin to ear, relic of a challenge she'd survived by biting through her opponent's throat while his axe was still in her face.

"We've seen da numbers, Blood-Chief. Da gate is dwarven-built. Even wit Skrixx's toys, we're looking at heavy losses on da first day."

"Yes."

"How heavy?"

"Three hundred. Maybe more."

The fire crackled. Somewhere below the ridge, a war-beast squealed in its pen, and the sound carried through the dark like a blade across stone.

"Three hundred dead to crack da outer wall," Gharza said. "And da outer wall is just da first ring. Dere are two more behind it."

"I know how many walls dey have."

"Den ya know da cost."

"I know da cost." Thokk met her eyes. "I also know what happens if we don't pay it."

Two winters. That was the number Grimtusk had given him a year ago, before the march. Two winters before the hunting grounds failed entirely. The game moved or died or got taken by the rot spreading through the deep woods. The fishing was half what it was five years back. The farms the shamans tried to grow — he didn't finish the thought. They all knew. Take the city — the valley, the forges, the food stores, the land that could grow things instead of killing them — or go home and watch their people starve.

"Dere's no third option," Urzag said.

Everyone looked at him. Urzag rarely spoke, and when he did, the words came out clean and hard, like coins dropped on stone.

"No," Thokk said. "Dere's not."

Krogan shifted his weight. "Da humans'll fight."

"Yes."

"Dey got walls. Dey got dat gate. Dey got soldiers who know da ground."

"Yes."

"Dey'll make us bleed for every step."

"Yes."

Krogan looked at the fire. "Good. If it was easy, it wouldn't be worth taking."

That was not what Thokk believed, but he let it stand. The deeper truth — that this siege was a desperate gamble by a people who had run out of everything except the strength in their arms — that truth was his to carry. It was what Warlords were for.

"Malga. Yer vanguard takes da gate. First blow, hard and fast. Hit dem before dey're ready."

"Dey'll be ready," Malga said.

"Den hit dem anyway."

She grinned. Not a happy expression. The look of a woman who had made peace with the thing she was good at and the price it demanded.

"Krogan, eastern flank. Find da weak stone. Skrixx says his sappers can crack it from below — I want yer warriors ready to pour through when da wall opens."

"And if Skrixx's sappers blow demselves up instead?"

"Den ya find another way through."

"Gharza, western approach. Pressure. Keep da defenders stretched, looking in two directions. Urzag — reserve. Watch da field. When ya see da break, fill it."

Urzag nodded. One motion. Done.

"Da spirits are unclear," Thokk said. "Grimtusk reads da bones and sees blood flowing in every direction. I don't know what dat means. I don't need to know. I need da wall to break. I need da gate to fall. I need my people to eat next winter. Dat is da only omen dat matters."

They rose. One by one, in order of rank — Malga first, because the vanguard carried the honour of the first strike; then Krogan and Gharza; then Urzag, who was always last because he was the one who stayed after everyone else had gone and made sure the fire was out.

But tonight, even Urzag left.

---

Thokk stood alone on the ridge.

Below, the camp stirred the way camps do before a battle — not with urgency, but with the heavy awareness of people who know the morning will be different from the night. Warriors checking straps, testing edges, speaking low. The war-beasts shifting in their pens, smelling something on the wind that made them restless. The goblins still hammering, always hammering, because Skrixx's people worked the way fire worked: until they ran out of things to consume.

Beyond the camp, the city.

Emberfall. The name meant something to the humans — Thokk didn't know what, and didn't care. To him it was walls and stone and the things inside them that his people needed to survive. Food. Forges. Land that could grow things instead of killing them. A future that lasted longer than two winters.

The defenders would be behind those walls now. Preparing the way he was preparing — checking weapons, posting sentries, doing the arithmetic of war. *How many do we have. How many do they have. How long can we hold.* Thokk had been on the other side of that arithmetic once, at a border fort along the ridgeline, when a human raiding party came hard and fast and he'd held the gate with thirty warriors against a hundred and twenty. He remembered the weight of it — the walls that were shelter and prison both, the counting that never added up.

The smoke from Emberfall's forges drifted across the valley, carrying the smell of hot iron and burning coal. It mixed with the camp smoke — cook fires, tanning pits, the herbal stink of Grimtusk's blessing preparations — and for a moment the two smells were indistinguishable. Human industry and orcish survival, blended in the air above a valley that would be soaked in blood by tomorrow's end.

He thought about Bloodtide Bay. The shore camps where the children played in the shallows. The great fires at the turning of the season, when the whole tribe gathered and the warriors danced the victory dances even in years when there were no victories, because the dancing mattered more than the winning. His wife, who had died three years ago in the lean winter when the sickness came through and took the old and the young, and who had told him with her last breath that the children needed to eat.

The children needed to eat.

He touched the skull at his belt. The old Warlord. Nine years he'd carried it. Dry and light — empty, the way all dead things were empty, the spirit gone to wherever spirits went when the body was done with them. He wondered if the old Warlord had carried this same weight. If every Warlord did. If the skull on the next Warlord's belt would be his, and the one after that — an endless chain of leaders who held their people up until their arms gave out.

The sky darkened. The last light bled along the western ridge in a line of copper and ash. Emberfall's forges glowed brighter as the dark pressed in — sparks rising from chimneys, the whole city pulsing with a dull heartbeat that never stopped.

He did not hate the humans. He understood them. They held what they had because holding was all there was. They fought because fighting was the only language the world accepted. The people on both sides of a wall always thought they were the ones defending.

Tomorrow the wall would bleed. His people would bleed. The humans behind their iron gate would bleed. And at the end of it — if the spirits willed it, if the bones were right, if strength and desperation and the refusal to die quietly were enough — the Ironclaw would eat next winter.

Thokk walked down the ridge toward his people.

The dark came in behind him.
