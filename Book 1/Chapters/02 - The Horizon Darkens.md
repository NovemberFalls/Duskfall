# CHAPTER TWO: THE HORIZON DARKENS

## Day 1 — Before the Siege

---

The city burned even when it wasn't burning.

Thokk stood on the ridge above the treeline and watched Emberfall breathe its black lung into the sky. Forge-smoke. The thick, greasy column that rose from the middle ring at all hours — dawn, dusk, the dead watches between — because the humans never stopped making things. Swords. Shields. Nails. Chains. The machinery of a people who had decided that the answer to every question was iron, and who fed their furnaces the way the Ironclaw fed their fires: constantly, desperately, as if stopping would mean the dark got in.

He understood that. More than they would have wanted him to.

The ridge gave him everything he needed. Emberfall sat in the crook of the valley like a fist of blackened stone, its three rings stacked tight — outer wall, middle wall, the inner keep rising above both like a broken tooth. The Sundered Gate faced north, a slab of dark iron set between two bastions that leaned inward as though the weight of the years had bent them. Rune-wards crawled across the gate's surface, faintly luminous even in daylight, the old dwarven work that the humans maintained but no longer understood.

Thokk had studied it for three days. The gate was strong. The walls behind it were not.

The flanks — the Iron Marches, the humans called them — ran east and west from the gate in a curve that followed the valley floor. Guard towers every two hundred paces. Ramparts wide enough for four men abreast. Well-built, well-maintained, the work of people who knew they lived in a world that wanted to kill them and had planned accordingly.

But there were cracks. The eastern section, where the wall met the river bluff, had been patched twice — different stone, different mortar, the seams visible even from the ridge. A breach point. Someone had come through there before, and the repair told Thokk two things: the stone was weaker than it looked, and the humans knew it.

The western flank was worse. The wall dipped where the old mining tunnels ran beneath it, the ground soft, the foundations settling. Skrixx had seen it before Thokk had, which was the only reason the goblin was still breathing.

Thokk turned from the city and looked at what he'd brought to kill it.

---

Twenty-five hundred.

They filled the valley below the ridge in a tide of hide and iron — the warbands spread across the broken ground in the loose formations the Ironclaw favoured, not the rigid lines the humans drew. Orc warriors didn't stand in rows. They stood where they could swing. Twelve hundred of his own — Ironclaw blood, the warriors who'd followed him from Bloodtide Bay through three seasons of hard march and harder choices. They squatted around cook fires, sharpened blades on river stones, checked armour straps with the methodical patience of people who knew that a loose buckle was as deadly as a sword.

Beyond them, in the flats where the trees thinned, Skrixx's goblins swarmed over their machines.

Eight hundred of them. Small, quick, loud in a way that made Thokk's jaw ache. They moved like insects — bursts of frantic motion, sudden stillness, then motion again — and they built things the same way. The siege engines squatted in the flats like wounded animals: catapults lashed together from timber and chain, their throwing arms tarred black, their cradles packed with the clay pots of alchemist's fire that the goblins mixed in batches and stored in holes they dug because even goblins knew better than to keep the stuff above ground.

The largest engine — the one Skrixx called the Jawbreaker, though it had been called four other things in the past week — was a trebuchet the size of a barn, its counterweight a cage of raw iron scavenged from the ruins of a dwarven outpost they'd passed six days ago. It creaked when the wind blew. Thokk did not trust it. Thokk did not trust anything that needed to be rebuilt after every third shot.

But Skrixx's machines had broken walls before. At Stonehaven. At the border forts along the ridgeline. They were ugly, unreliable, and effective, and those were three qualities Thokk could work with.

The fifth hundred were something else.

They stood apart. They always stood apart. The Revenants — Bane's Kissed, the dead things that had crawled out of the northern bogs after the corruption spread and attached themselves to any army large enough to attract their attention. They did not eat. They did not speak. They stood in their lines at the edge of the camp with their grey skin and their hollow eyes and their weapons that were older than anything alive, and they waited.

Thokk did not like them. He did not trust them. He used them because the alternative was fighting without them, and the math did not allow that.

The math did not allow much of anything, these days.

---

"Da bones are quiet."

Grimtusk said it the way he said everything — flat, without decoration, the words dropping from his mouth like stones into still water. He was squatting beside the fire pit they'd dug on the ridge's western face, his hands hovering over the scatter of bone fragments he'd cast into the ash. Wolf knuckles. Three of them. The traditional casting for a war-reading, the same bones his father had used, and his father's father, back through the line to the first War-Shamans who had heard the spirits speak in the crackle of burning marrow.

Thokk stood over him and waited.

Grimtusk was old. Older than Thokk by twenty years, which put him past sixty — ancient by orcish measure, a feat of stubbornness and spiritual power that had kept him alive through wars that had killed younger, stronger shamans. His body was a map of survival: ritual scars covering his arms and chest in patterns that told the story of every battle he'd blessed, every warrior he'd sent into the ground, every spirit he'd called up from the deep places where the ancestors waited. His tusks were capped with copper — the mark of a High War-Shaman, the one who spoke to the strongest spirits — and his eyes were the milky grey of a man who saw things that existed in places where colour did not apply.

He picked up a bone. Turned it. Set it down.

"Quiet how?" Thokk asked.

"Not silent. Quiet." Grimtusk traced a line in the ash with one thick finger. "Da spirits are dere. I feel dem. But dey don't speak clear. Dey shift. Like smoke in wind — present, but ya can't hold it."

"Victory or defeat?"

"Neither. Both." Grimtusk looked up. His grey eyes caught the firelight and held it, and for a moment Thokk saw something in them that he did not have a word for — not fear, not doubt, but the expression of a man who had spent his whole life listening to voices that had always answered, and was now hearing something he did not recognize.

"Da bones show blood. Dey always show blood before a siege. But da pattern is wrong. Da blood don't flow one way. It flows everywhere. Like da ground is drinking it."

Thokk said nothing.

"I can bless da weapons," Grimtusk continued. "I can mark da warriors. Da rites will hold — da spirits are not gone, dey are not angry. Dey are..." He paused, searching for the word the way a man searches for a handhold on a cliff face. "Confused."

"Spirits don't get confused."

"Dese ones do." Grimtusk gathered the bones and folded them back into the leather pouch he wore at his waist. His hands were steady. They were always steady. "I'm telling ya what I see, Blood-Chief. Da spirits are dere, but da world beneath dem is changing. Something is wrong in da deep places. Da old connections — da lines between us and da ancestors — dey're thinning. Like roots in bad soil."

Thokk looked at the fire. The flames moved the way flames always moved — consuming, indifferent, alive in the way that things without choices were alive.

"Can ya still bless da warbands?"

"Yes."

"Can ya still read da dead after da fighting?"

"Yes."

"Den dat's enough."

Grimtusk watched him for a long moment. Then he nodded — a single dip of his heavy head, the motion of a shaman accepting a warlord's decision because that was the order of things, even when the bones said the order of things was changing.

"I'll prepare da rites for dawn."

"Before dawn. Da assault starts at first light."

Grimtusk rose. He moved slowly — not from weakness, but from the deliberate care of a man who carried more weight than his body and understood that rushing was the privilege of people who hadn't learned what haste could cost.

He stopped at the edge of the firelight.

"Dere is one more thing."

Thokk waited.

"Da bones showed a number. Seven." Grimtusk turned the word over, testing its edges. "Seven strikes. I don't know what it means. Da spirits wouldn't say."

He walked into the dark. Thokk watched him go.

Seven.

The number meant nothing to him. Not yet.

---

The War-Chiefs came at dusk.

There were four of them — the leaders of the four major warbands that made up the Ironclaw host. Krogan Bloodtusk, who commanded the eastern assault force, three hundred strong, and who had fought beside Thokk at Stonehaven when they were both young enough to believe that winning a battle meant something beyond surviving it. Gharza Splitjaw, who led the western warband, two hundred and fifty warriors, and who had the distinction of being the only orc in the host who argued with Thokk to his face — a quality that Thokk tolerated because Gharza was usually right, and a leader who surrounded himself with agreement was a leader walking toward a cliff with his eyes closed. Urzag the Quiet, who commanded the reserve and the war-beasts, and who had not spoken more than twenty words in any council Thokk had attended — but whose silence carried a weight that made other orcs listen to the things he didn't say. And Malga Bonefist, who led the vanguard — the warriors who went first, the ones who hit the wall before anyone else, the ones who died fastest and knew it.

They sat around the fire because that was where decisions lived. Not in tents. Not behind walls. Around a fire, where the smoke carried the words to the ancestors and the flames lit the faces of the men who would live or die by what was said.

Thokk stood. The War-Chiefs sat. This was the way.

"Tomorrow," Thokk said.

No one spoke. No one needed to. They had marched for three months. They had watched the human city from these hills for three days. They knew what tomorrow meant.

"Da Jawbreaker and da smaller engines hit da gate and da eastern flank at first light. Skrixx's sappers go in under da western wall while da bombardment holds their eyes. Krogan takes da eastern approach. Gharza takes da west. Malga, yer vanguard hits da gate itself."

Malga Bonefist nodded. She was broad, scarred, her left ear gone from a fight she'd won when she was sixteen. She had led the vanguard at four sieges. She would lead it at this one. If the gate took her, another would step up. That was the way.

"Da Revenants?" Krogan asked. His voice was deep — deeper than Thokk's, which was a rare thing. He spoke the way old trees fell: slowly, with a sense of inevitability.

"Reserve. Dey go in when da wall breaks. Not before."

"And if da wall don't break?"

"It'll break."

Gharza leaned forward. The firelight caught the split in her jaw — a scar that ran from her chin to her left ear, the relic of a challenge she'd survived by biting through her opponent's throat while his axe was still in her face. She had opinions. She always had opinions.

"We've seen da numbers, Blood-Chief. Da gate is strong. Dwarven-built. Even wit Skrixx's toys, we're looking at heavy losses on da first day."

"Yes."

"How heavy?"

Thokk met her eyes. "Three hundred. Maybe more."

Silence. The fire crackled. Somewhere below the ridge, a war-beast — one of the great boars the Ironclaw used as mounts — squealed in its pen, and the sound carried through the dark like a blade across stone.

"Three hundred dead to crack da outer wall," Gharza said. "And da outer wall is just da first ring. Dere are two more behind it."

"I know how many walls dey have."

"Den ya know da cost."

"I know da cost." Thokk looked at her, and in that look was the thing that made him Warlord — not his size, not his strength, not the skull of the last Blood-Chief hanging from his belt, but the capacity to hold the weight of a terrible decision without looking away from the people it would kill. "I also know what happens if we don't pay it."

The fire burned between them.

Thokk had done this arithmetic before. In the quiet hours, in the cold mornings when the camp was still and the only sounds were the wind across the ridge and the distant clang of Skrixx's goblins building something that would probably explode. He had counted his people — not the warriors, but all of them. The ones back at Bloodtide Bay. The old ones. The children. The mothers who were nursing through winters that came earlier each year and lasted longer. The hunters who came home with less meat each season, moving through forests that were thinning, tracking game that was disappearing, reading signs that said the same thing every time: *the land is dying*.

Two winters. That was the number Grimtusk had given him a year ago, before the march, before the decision, before any of this. Two winters before the hunting grounds failed entirely. Two winters before the Ironclaw started eating their dead or their young, and Thokk had seen what happened to the tribes that reached that point. The Ashblood had. The Thornteeth. They didn't die all at once — they thinned, frayed, scattered into the badlands and became the ragged, half-feral bands that haunted the margins of every territory, begging and stealing and dying in ones and twos until the name itself was forgotten.

He would not let that happen to his people.

"Two winters," Thokk said, because the War-Chiefs knew it but needed to hear it again, the way a blade needed to be sharpened even when the edge was already keen. "Dat's what we got. Da hunting grounds north of Bloodtide are gone — da game moved or died or got taken by da rot dat's spreading through da deep woods. Da fishing is half what it was five years back. Da farms da shamans tried to grow — " He didn't finish. They all knew what had happened to the farms. "We take dis city, we take da valley, we take da forges and da food stores and da land dat feeds dem. Or we go home and watch our people starve."

"Dere's no third option," Urzag said.

Everyone looked at him. Urzag rarely spoke, and when he did, the words came out clean and hard, like coins dropped on stone.

"No," Thokk said. "Dere's not."

Krogan shifted his weight. "Da humans'll fight."

"Yes."

"Dey got walls. Dey got dat gate. Dey got soldiers who know da ground."

"Yes."

"Dey'll make us bleed for every step."

"Yes."

Krogan looked at the fire. "Good. If it was easy, it wouldn't be worth taking."

That was not what Thokk believed, but he let it stand. Let Krogan have his warrior's pride. Let the War-Chiefs carry the version of the truth that would keep them swinging when the blood started flowing. The deeper truth — that this siege was not about glory or honour or the old ways, that it was a desperate gamble by a people who had run out of everything except the strength in their arms and the fear of what happened if they stopped — that truth was Thokk's to carry. It was what Warlords were for.

"Malga. Yer vanguard takes da gate. I want da first blow hard and fast. Hit dem before dey're ready. Make dem react."

"Dey'll be ready," Malga said.

"Den hit dem anyway."

She grinned. It was not a happy expression. It was the look of a woman who had made peace with the thing she was good at and the price it demanded.

"Krogan, eastern flank. Find da weak stone. Skrixx says his sappers can crack it from below — I want yer warriors ready to pour through when da wall opens."

"And if Skrixx's sappers blow demselves up instead?"

"Den ya find another way through."

Krogan snorted. It was the closest he came to laughter.

"Gharza, western approach. Da soft ground. Yer job is pressure — keep da defenders stretched, keep dem looking in two directions. When Malga hits da gate, I want da humans on dat wall wondering where da next blow is coming from."

"And Urzag?"

"Reserve. Watch da field. When ya see da break, fill it."

Urzag nodded. One motion. Done.

Thokk looked at them — four leaders, four warbands, the sum total of what the Ironclaw had left to bet on a future they might not see. Krogan with his deep voice and his old loyalty. Gharza with her scars and her uncomfortable truths. Malga with her grin and her willingness to go first. Urzag with his silence and his patience and the weight of everything he chose not to say.

They would lose some of them. Maybe all. That was what siege meant. That was what this war demanded.

Thokk had carried the skull of the last Warlord for nine years. He had earned it in the old way — three wars won, the challenge met, the blood spilled. He wore it because it was expected, because it reminded the clan who led them and what leadership cost. But in the firelight, with the War-Chiefs watching him and the city below them breathing its black smoke into the sky, the skull felt heavier than it ever had.

"Tomorrow," he said again. "We hit dem at first light. We take da outer ring or we die trying. Dere's no retreat. Dere's no second plan. We go forward because dere is no backward."

He paused. The fire popped. A log shifted, sending a cascade of sparks into the dark above them.

"Da spirits are unclear. Grimtusk reads da bones and sees blood flowing in every direction. I don't know what dat means. I don't need to know. I need da wall to break. I need da gate to fall. I need my people to eat next winter." He looked at each of them in turn. "Dat is da only omen dat matters."

They rose. One by one, in order of rank — Malga first, because the vanguard carried the honour of the first strike; then Krogan and Gharza; and finally Urzag, who was always last because he was the one who stayed after everyone else had gone and made sure the fire was out.

But tonight, even Urzag left.

Thokk stood alone on the ridge.

---

Below him, the camp stirred in the way that camps do before a battle — not with urgency, but with the particular, heavy awareness of people who know that the morning will be different from the night. Warriors checking straps, testing edges, speaking in low voices to the men and women beside them. The war-beasts shifting in their pens, smelling something on the wind that made them restless. The goblins still hammering, always hammering, because Skrixx's people worked the way fire worked: until they ran out of things to consume.

And beyond the camp, the city.

Emberfall. A name that meant something to the humans — Thokk didn't know what, and didn't care. To him it was walls and stone and the things inside them that his people needed to survive. Food. Forges. Land that could grow things instead of killing them. A future that lasted longer than two winters.

He looked at the walls.

The defenders would be behind them now. Preparing the way he was preparing — checking weapons, posting sentries, doing the arithmetic of war. How many do we have. How many do they have. How long can we hold. Thokk had been on the other side of that arithmetic once, at a border fort along the ridgeline, when a human raiding party had come in fast and hard and he'd held the gate with thirty warriors against a hundred and twenty. He remembered the weight of it — the walls that were shelter and prison both, the counting that never added up, the grinding certainty that the only way out was through.

He did not think about whether the defenders were brave. He knew they were. Brave and desperate and fighting for everything they had, the same way he was. That was the thing about walls — the people on both sides thought they were the ones defending.

The smoke from Emberfall's forges drifted across the valley, carrying the smell of hot iron and burning coal. It mixed with the camp smoke — the cook fires, the tanning pits, the herbal stink of Grimtusk's blessing preparations — and for a moment the two smells were indistinguishable. Human industry and orcish survival, blended in the air above a valley that would be soaked in blood by tomorrow's end.

Thokk breathed it in.

He thought about Bloodtide Bay. The shore camps where the children played in the shallows while the elders watched from the bluffs. The great fires they built at the turning of the season, when the whole tribe gathered and the shamans spoke the old words and the warriors danced the victory dances even in years when there were no victories, because the dancing mattered more than the winning. His wife, who had died three years ago in the lean winter when the sickness came through the camp and took the old and the young and the ones who couldn't fight it off, and who had told him, with her last breath, that the children needed to eat.

The children needed to eat.

That was the omen. That was the bone-reading. That was the only truth the spirits could have given him that he would have listened to, and they hadn't needed to say it because he heard it every morning when he woke and every night when the dark came in and the fires died to coals and the weight of twenty-five hundred lives pressed against his chest like a hand.

He touched the skull at his belt. The old Warlord. The one who'd come before. Thokk had killed him nine years ago in the challenge circle, taken his skull, taken his place, taken the weight. The skull was dry and light — empty, the way all dead things were empty, the spirit gone to wherever spirits went when the body was done with them.

He wondered, sometimes, if the old Warlord had carried this same weight. If every Warlord did. If the skull on the next Warlord's belt would be his, and the one after that, and the one after that, an endless chain of leaders who held their people up until their arms gave out and then became the thing the next leader carried.

The sky was darkening. The last light bled along the western ridge in a line of copper and ash, and the valley below was filling with shadow. Emberfall's forges glowed brighter as the dark pressed in — orange sparks rising from the chimneys, the furnace-light visible through the streets of the outer ring, the whole city pulsing with a dull, industrial heartbeat that never stopped.

Thokk watched it.

He did not hate the humans. He did not hate their city or their walls or the soldiers who would die defending them. He understood them. They held what they had because holding was all there was. They fought because fighting was the only language the world accepted. They would kill his warriors and he would kill theirs, and in the end, whoever was left standing would call it victory and try to build something on the pile of dead that made it possible.

That was Bloodhollow. That was the way things were.

He turned from the ridge.

The camp was waiting. The War-Chiefs were briefing their warriors. Grimtusk was preparing the dawn blessings — the oil, the bone-ash, the old words that called the ancestors close. Skrixx was somewhere in the goblin section, cackling over a pot of something that would probably catch fire, adjusting the Jawbreaker's tension for the hundredth time, doing the thing goblins did: making chaos into a weapon and hoping it pointed the right direction.

Tomorrow the wall would bleed. His people would bleed. The humans behind their iron gate would bleed.

And at the end of it — if the spirits willed it, if the bones were right, if strength and desperation and the refusal to die quietly were enough — the Ironclaw would eat next winter.

Thokk walked down the ridge toward his people.

The dark came in behind him.
