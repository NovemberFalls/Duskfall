# CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR: THE GATE

## Day 6 — The Final Push

---

The barricade was gone.

Thokk stood at the edge of the crater where the secondary barricade had been and looked at what Skrixx's charges had made of it. The basalt blocks that the human engineers had fitted with precision — the blocks that had killed fourteen warriors in the gap, the blocks that had turned Gharza's assault into a slaughter — were scattered across the avenue like a giant's discarded knucklebones. The timber bracing was splinters. The crossfire positions on either side had collapsed inward, the buildings sagging where the detonation had pulled their foundations out from under them.

The avenue was open.

For the first time in six days, Thokk could see straight through to the heart of the human defense. The street ran south past the blown barricade, past the rubble field where bodies lay in the positions the blast had thrown them — human and orc together, the explosion making no distinction — and beyond, through the thinning smoke, the southern edge of the Anvil District. The dormitory buildings. The civilian shelters. And behind them, visible as a dark line against the bruised sky, the wall of the inner ring.

The Emberheart.

The last gate.

Krogan was beside him. The War-Chief's scalp wound had reopened for the third time — the black gut stitches finally surrendering to the sustained violence of a body that had not rested long enough for any wound to close. The blood ran in the old channel, down the groove of the ancient scar, and Krogan ignored it the way he ignored everything that was not the next fight or the last count.

"Da barricade blew clean," Krogan said. "Skrixx's timing was good. Three charges, all at once. Da avenue is open from da breach to da southern dormitories."

"Casualties?"

"Ours — eleven in da blast zone. Dey were too close. Da assault wave hit da barricade just before da charges went, and da ones on da rubble—" He stopped. The stopping was not a pause. It was the act of a man recognizing that the eleven on the rubble had been doing what he had told them to do, and the telling had put them where the blast found them. "Eleven."

Eleven more. Added to the morning's count. Added to the number that had been climbing since dawn like smoke from a pyre that had been fed too much wood — steadily, visibly, with the quality of a thing that was not going to stop until the fuel ran out or the fire was smothered.

"Da humans?" Thokk asked.

"Scattered. Da blast broke deir line. Most pulled south — fighting withdrawal, same as every time. But it's different now." Krogan's deep voice carried something that was not quite satisfaction and not quite grief and sat in the space between the two where the truth of battlefield mathematics lived. "Dey're running out of places to withdraw to."

Thokk looked south down the open avenue. The shapes were there — human defenders moving in the smoke, the organized motion of soldiers falling back to secondary positions. But the motion was different. Faster. Less controlled. The disciplined retreats of Days 2 through 5 — the fighting withdrawals that cost the Ironclaw more than the humans, the measured surrendering of ground that purchased time at the price of Thokk's warriors — were gone. What replaced them was something rawer. Soldiers running because the alternative was standing in the path of an army that had just blown their wall out from under their feet.

Emberfall was breaking.

He could feel it the way he had felt the spirits before the spirits went far — not with his hands or his eyes but with the sense that lived beneath the senses, the instinct of a leader who had watched armies crack and knew the sound, the weight, the particular quality of a force that had reached the boundary between fighting and finished. The boundary was not a line. It was a pressure — the same pressure that sat in Thokk's own chest, behind the locked room, in the place where the arithmetic lived. When the pressure exceeded the will, the will gave. Individuals first. Then squads. Then the whole structure, all at once, the way a wall stood and stood and stood and then fell.

The human commander's wall was falling.

"Bring da warbands forward," Thokk said. "All of dem. Krogan — yer warband takes da avenue. Gharza, da eastern approach. I want every warrior who can hold a weapon in da push."

"Da Revenants?"

"Behind us. Reserve line. If we stall, dey fill da gap."

Krogan nodded. The nod was not eager. The nod was the heavy, downward motion of a head that understood what *all of dem* meant — every warrior, every body, the last reserves committed to the final push, the moment in a siege when the commander stopped managing attrition and started spending everything because the spending was the only way to reach the end.

"And you, Blood-Chief?"

"At da front."

Krogan looked at him. The assessment was the same assessment every War-Chief performed when the Warlord said the words that Warlords said before the last battle — the weighing, the measuring, the question that lived behind the loyalty: *are you going to fight, or are you going to die?*

The answer was both. It was always both. That was what the front meant.

"Yah," Krogan said. Nothing else. The word was sufficient. It carried the weight of six days and the count of the dead and the recognition that the Warlord's decision was not a decision but an inevitability — the Warlord at the front because the front was where Warlords died and the dying was the duty and the duty was the chain, skull to skull, the weight passed from one set of shoulders to the next.

Krogan turned and went north, toward the staging area, toward his warband, toward the warriors who would follow the order because the order was the only thing left and the following was the last act of faith the Ironclaw had.

---

Grimtusk found him in the rubble.

Thokk was standing in the crater where the barricade's centre had been — the lowest point of the blast, where Skrixx's charges had turned the street into a bowl of shattered stone and broken timber. The dust was still settling. The air tasted of goblin compound — the sharp, chemical bite of the blasting mixture, the residue that coated everything the detonation touched. Beneath the chemical taste, the other taste — blood, stone, the mineral flavour of a city being unmade.

The old shaman came down into the crater slowly. The staff took his weight on every step — more weight today than yesterday, more than the day before, the gradual, accelerating surrender of a body that had been carrying a man and a calling for seventy years and was reaching the end of what carrying could do. The milky grey eyes were not looking at the crater. They were looking through it, past it, at the thing beneath the physical destruction that shaman eyes saw and warrior eyes did not.

"Grimtusk."

"Blood-Chief." The voice was quiet. Not the quiet of the crossroads on Day 5, which had been the quiet of a man delivering truth that had no volume. This was quieter still. The quiet of a man who had passed through the truth and arrived at the thing on the other side — the place where the truth had been processed and the processing had produced not understanding but acceptance, the flat, terminal acceptance of a physician who had examined the patient and found what could not be treated.

"Da bones?" Thokk asked. Not because he expected an answer. Because the question was a ritual between them — older than the siege, older than the march, the call-and-response of a Warlord and a shaman that stretched back through every casting and every campaign and every night when the fire burned and the bones spoke and the spirits pressed against the living world with their warmth and their guidance and their presence.

Grimtusk reached into the leather pouch. The wolf knuckles came out — three small bones in his scarred palm, the surfaces dark with the patina of forty years of use. He held them the way he had held them at the crossroads. The way a man held a tool that no longer worked.

"I didn't cast," he said.

Thokk looked at him. In six days of siege and thirty years of service, Grimtusk da Bonechanter had never not cast. The casting was as fundamental to the old shaman as breathing — the daily practice, the connection to the ancestors, the act that defined what he was and anchored him to the thing that gave the definition meaning. Not casting was not an option. Not casting was the spiritual equivalent of a warrior refusing to draw his sword.

"Why?"

Grimtusk closed his hand over the bones. The gesture was the one from Day 5 — the protective hold, the fingers curling around the things that represented the connection. But on Day 5, the hold had been protective. Today it was something else. Today it was the hold of a man covering something that was finished, the way a hand covered a wound that would not close — not to protect, but to contain. To keep the thing that was ending from ending in the open where everyone could see.

"Dere's nothing to hear," Grimtusk said. "Da channel is closed. Not closing — closed. Da thing I've been listening to for forty years... it's like pressing yer ear against a wall and hearing da people on da other side, deir voices, deir movement, and den da wall becomes thicker. And thicker. And now da wall is so thick dat dere's nothing. Not silence — silence is what you hear when someone stops talking. Dis is what you hear when da room on da other side is gone."

Gone.

The word was smaller than the thing it described. The spirits were not quiet. The spirits were not far. The spirits were gone — the channel closed, the connection severed, the thread between the living and the dead that had been the Ironclaw's oldest inheritance snapped by whatever was happening beneath the surface of Bloodhollow, whatever rot the Veilfire had spread into the deep places where the connections lived.

Thokk stood in the crater and held the word the way he held everything — in the locked room, behind the ribs, in the place where the truths that were too heavy for daylight waited with the numbers and the names and the weight of four hundred dead warriors whose pyres had burned without passage and whose smoke had risen into a sky that received nothing.

"Da rites," he said. "For da ones who die today."

"I'll speak da words. I'll draw da marks." Grimtusk's milky eyes held the thing that had been growing since Day 5 — not fear, not grief, but the expression of a man who had reached the end of his oldest certainty and found it empty. "But da words will be words. Da marks will be marks. Da dead will go into da fire and what comes out will be smoke. Just smoke."

Just smoke.

The phrase from Day 5. The phrase that had sat between them at the crossroads like a stone that could not be moved. But on Day 5, it had been a warning. Today it was a fact — a settled, final fact, the kind that did not change when you turned it over or looked at it from another angle. The kind that was the same from every direction because it was the same in every direction, the way a closed door was a closed door regardless of which side you stood on.

"Den we fight without dem," Thokk said.

The words arrived from the locked room. Not from faith — the spirits had been his faith, and the faith was gone. Not from hope — hope required a future that extended past the wall ahead, and the wall ahead was the only future Thokk could see. From the place beneath faith and hope, the place where the chain lived — skull to skull, Warlord to Warlord, the weight passed from one carrier to the next. The spirits had carried the Ironclaw for a thousand years. The spirits were gone. The carrying did not stop because the carriers changed.

Thokk would carry.

"Da number," Grimtusk said.

"What?"

"Seven." The old shaman opened his hand. The wolf knuckles lay in his palm — cold, dark, the bones of an animal that had been dead for longer than Thokk had been alive, the tools of a practice that was older than the Ironclaw and was ending in a crater in a city that smelled like compound and blood. "Da last thing da spirits sent before da channel closed. Da number seven. I felt it again dis morning — not through da bones, not through da casting. In da quiet. Like an echo in a room after da person speaking has left. Da word is still in da air but da mouth dat spoke it is gone."

Seven.

The number that Grimtusk had read on the first night, in the bones, in the blood, in the cracked wolf knuckle that sat in Thokk's pouch beside the old Warlord's skull. The number that had been persistent, uninterpretable, attached to something the bones could show but could not explain. Seven strikes. Seven of something. The spirits' last message — their final word, pushed through a closing channel with the desperate urgency of a voice calling through a door that was swinging shut.

"I don't know what it means," Grimtusk said. "I've never not known. Forty years. Every casting — even da bad ones, even da ones dat showed blood and breaking — I knew what da spirits meant. I could feel da shape of da truth even when da truth was ugly. But dis—" He turned the wolf knuckles over. Cold bone in cold hands. "Dis is a word in a language I used to speak. And da language is gone."

Thokk took the cracked wolf knuckle from his pouch. Held it beside the old Warlord's skull. The bone and the bone. The spirit and the dead. Both cold now. Both carrying nothing except the memory of what they had carried — the warmth, the weight, the presence that had been the thing that separated the Ironclaw from the Revenants, the living from the merely moving.

"Seven," Thokk said. He looked south, down the avenue, toward the wall and the gate and the commander who waited behind them. "Den whatever it means, it means it today. Because today is da last day. We go through dat gate or we don't. And if seven is da price, we pay it. If seven is da answer, we find it. If seven is da thing da spirits died trying to tell us—"

He put the wolf knuckle back in the pouch. Closed the leather. The closing was a small act — fingers on a drawstring, the motion of a hand performing a function it had performed a thousand times. But the closing today carried the weight of a door being shut from the inside, the conscious decision to put away the tool that no longer worked and rely on the things that still did: the body, the weapon, the will, the chain.

"—den we hear it when we hear it."

---

The warbands assembled in the avenue behind the blown barricade.

Thokk stood on the rubble at the crater's northern edge and watched them come. They came from the alleys and the buildings and the positions they had held through the night and the dawn's assault, filtering into the avenue in the groups and formations that six days of urban fighting had shaped them into — not the ranked columns of the first day, not the disciplined war-lines that had marched from Bloodtide Bay, but the compressed, battered clusters of warriors who had been ground together by the siege the way ore was ground together by the forge, the shapes changed, the material harder, the purpose the same.

Krogan's warband. What remained of it. The War-Chief at the front — the blood on his scalp dried to a black line, his armour scarred, the massive frame diminished by six days of fighting and not eating enough and the specific, structural erosion that the death of a son produced in a father's body. Behind him, his warriors. Fewer than Thokk wanted to count. More than none.

Gharza's western warband. Gharza herself at the left flank, her axe on her shoulder, the scar from chin to ear pulling her face into the expression that was not quite a smile. She was unwounded. Still. The debt still unpaid. Thokk had seen warriors like her before — the ones the blades could not find, the ones the arrows missed, the ones who walked through six days of siege without a scratch while the men beside them fell in twos and threes. The spirits had a word for them. Thokk could not remember it. The spirits were gone and the words they carried were going with them.

Malga's vanguard. What was left of it. Malga was not at the front.

Thokk looked for her. Scanned the vanguard line — the warriors she had led through four sieges and the fifth and the streets that had eaten them faster than the walls. Malga's face was not among them. The grin was not among them.

A warrior — young, one of Malga's seconds, a woman named Drekkha whose face carried the particular expression of a person delivering news that had already been delivered to her and that she was now required to pass along — stepped forward.

"War-Chief Bonefist is dead, Blood-Chief."

The words arrived. They entered the locked room. The locked room was full — had been full since the count on Day 4, since the number crossed the line between heavy and crushing — and the words found no space and pressed against the walls and the walls held because that was what the walls of the locked room did. They held.

"When?"

"Da shamans took da arm at dawn. Da poison was past da shoulder. Dey—" Drekkha paused. The pause was not hesitation. It was the act of finding words for a thing that words could not properly hold. "She woke after. Tried to stand. Her body..." Another pause, shorter, the brevity of a woman who wanted this report over. "Her body was done. She went fast after dat. Grimtusk was wit her."

Thokk looked at Grimtusk. The old shaman nodded once — the slow, weighted motion of a head carrying the knowledge of what he had seen, the dying of a War-Chief who had led from the front at four sieges and who had walked out of each one with new scars and the grin that said *I went first and I'm still here.* The grin that was gone now. The woman who was gone now. The vanguard that was hers and was now no one's.

"She said something?" Thokk asked.

"She said, 'Tell da Blood-Chief I went first.'" Drekkha's voice cracked on the last word. The crack was small — a hairline fracture in a voice that had been holding for six days — and it healed itself immediately, the way cracks in warriors' voices healed, through the application of the next breath and the next word and the refusal to let the crack widen into the thing beneath.

*I went first.*

Malga Bonefist. The woman who led the vanguard. The woman whose arm had been dying since Day 2 and whose grin had been dying since Day 5 and whose body had followed both into the ground this morning while Thokk was standing in a crater counting the cost of charges he had ordered detonated.

He put her in the locked room. There was no space. He put her there anyway.

"Drekkha. You have da vanguard."

The young warrior's eyes widened — a fraction, a moment, the involuntary response of a body receiving information the mind had not yet processed. Then the eyes narrowed. The jaw set. The expression that was not Malga's grin but was the thing that would have to replace it — the determination of a warrior who had been given a duty that was too large and would carry it because the alternative was letting it fall.

"Yah, Blood-Chief."

"Front line. Behind me."

"Yah."

She went back to the vanguard. To the warriors who had been Malga's and were now hers and who needed to see someone at the front with an expression that said *we go* and Drekkha's expression said *we go* and the saying was enough.

---

Skrixx came through the lines as the warbands formed.

The goblin was alive. Thokk noted this the way he noted the structural integrity of a wall or the depth of a ford — as a fact that affected the next calculation, the next decision, the next step in the arithmetic of a siege that had reduced everything to variables. Skrixx was alive. Skrixx's value was in his head. The head was still on the body. Good.

But the body had paid.

The burns on Skrixx's forearms — the old ones, the mapped record of every risk taken and survived — had been joined by new ones. Fresh burns on his hands, the skin red and weeping, the specific, chemical damage that goblin blasting compound produced when it was handled in quantities that the handler should not have been handling in conditions that the handling was not designed for. The copper eyes blinked rapidly — not the usual speed, faster, the overclock of a mind that had been running at full capacity for hours and had not yet been given permission to slow.

"Da charges worked," Skrixx said. The professional satisfaction was there — diminished, running on fumes, but present, the irreducible core of a builder who had built something that did what it was supposed to do. "Three detonations. Simultaneous. Da barricade's foundation is gone. Da street is open."

"I see it."

"I'm pulling my sappers back. Da tunnel network is compromised — da detonations collapsed two of da three primary passages. Da third is flooded." He paused. The pause was the calculation, the running of numbers that never stopped, the equation that was always being updated. "I have forty-six goblins left. Combat-effective. My catapults on da ridge are out of ammunition — da last rounds went into da secondary barricade positions yesterday. I can rig fire-pots from da remaining compound, but da compound is—"

"Enough," Thokk said.

Skrixx stopped. The copper eyes registered the interruption — data, input, a variable.

"Ya've done what ya came to do. Da walls are down. Da barricade is down. Da way in is open because ya opened it."

Thokk looked at the goblin who had built the engines that broke the outer wall and the charges that blew the barricade and the fire-pots that burned in the night and the tunnels that ran beneath the streets and the fuses that he had cut himself because the man who should have cut them was dead and the skill could not be replaced. Skrixx Blazebinder. The Pyrelord. The creature whose copper eyes moved faster than conversation and whose mind processed the world as an engineering problem and who had solved problem after problem for six days and who was standing here with burned hands and depleted supplies and the particular expression of a goblin who had spent everything and was calculating what remained.

"Pull yer goblins to da ridge," Thokk said. "Hold da siege engine positions. If we take da gate, I'll need yer engineers for whatever's on da other side. If we don't—"

He did not finish. He did not need to. Skrixx's copper eyes had already completed the sentence — the same equation, the same variable, the same output that every mind in the army had calculated and that no one spoke aloud because speaking it would give it the weight of a thing that was real instead of a thing that was possible. *If we don't take the gate, the army is finished.*

"Da ridge," Skrixx said. Not acknowledgment. Assessment. The goblin was already calculating the route, the positioning, the defensive variables that would determine whether forty-six goblins on a ridge could survive whatever came after the thing that came next.

"Keep yer people alive, Skrixx. Dat's da last order."

The copper eyes blinked. Something moved behind them — not the calculation, not the equation, but the thing beneath the variables that even a mind like Skrixx's could not reduce to numbers. The thing that was gratitude or recognition or the goblin equivalent of the nod Krogan had given, the acknowledgment that the order was not about the ridge or the positioning but about the fact that the Warlord was saying *survive* to a goblin and meaning it.

"Da fuses don't take orders, Blood-Chief."

The same words from Day 5. The same flat, professional delivery. But the eyes were different. The eyes were the eyes of a creature who understood that the man giving the order was not going to follow it himself.

Skrixx Blazebinder turned and moved through the orc lines — fast, erratic, the trajectory of a creature whose natural state was motion. He smelled like compound and blood and the chemical residue of a profession that consumed its practitioners. His burned hands left dark prints on every surface he touched. He vanished into the smoke, heading north, heading for the ridge, heading for the siege engine positions where forty-six goblins waited for orders from a Pyrelord whose greatest weapon was the thing between his ears and whose greatest risk had always been the things beneath his hands.

Thokk watched him go.

Skrixx would survive. The goblin was a survivor the way fire was hot — not as a quality but as a definition, the fundamental nature of a creature built from innovation and desperation and the refusal to stop building. The ridge would hold or it would not, and Skrixx would adapt or escape or invent something new from whatever the ruins provided, because that was what goblins did. That was what Skrixx did.

The Pyrelord would survive. Thokk held this as the last thing that sat right in his chest. Everything else sat wrong — the dead, the silence, the closed channel, Malga's body wherever the shamans had laid it, the number seven echoing in an empty room. But Skrixx's survival sat right. The goblin would carry the fire forward, wherever forward went.

---

The Ironclaw surged south.

Thokk was at the front.

He moved through the avenue with the war-axe in his right hand and the tower shield on his left arm and the skull at his belt and the cold wolf knuckle in its pouch and the locked room full and the locked room holding. The warbands were behind him — Krogan's on the avenue, Gharza's filtering through the eastern buildings, Drekkha's vanguard tight against Thokk's back in the formation that Malga had drilled into them: the wedge, the pointed edge, the shape that said *the front is here and the front goes first.*

The first resistance hit them fifty paces past the blown barricade.

Human soldiers in a forge-shop on the left — one of the buildings that had survived the blast, the walls cracked but standing, the arrow slits still functional. Bolts came through the gaps — two, three, the flat crack of crossbow strings releasing, the sound that had been killing Ironclaw warriors in the alleys for two days. A warrior beside Thokk took a bolt through the throat. The warrior fell without a sound — the bolt having severed the thing that made sound, the body going from vertical to horizontal in the time it took the next bolt to arrive.

Thokk did not stop.

"Through da building," he said. The order was not loud. It did not need to be. The warriors behind him — the ones who had survived six days, who had learned the alleys, who understood that a building with arrow slits was a building that needed to be emptied — were already moving. Four of them — Krogan's — hit the door. The door held. They hit it again. It broke. They went through.

The sounds from inside were short. Compressed. The specific, intimate sounds of close-quarters fighting — blade on blade, the crash of bodies against walls, a shout that was not a word but a frequency, the sound the human body made when something orcish hit it in a space too small for the hit to miss.

Silence.

Krogan's warriors came out. Three of the four. The fourth was inside, and the inside was the place where the fourth would stay.

Thokk kept moving.

The avenue narrowed as they pushed south. The buildings closed in — the forge-shops and worker quarters of the Anvil's industrial heart, the structures that had been gutted by the firebombing six months ago and that the human commander had turned into fighting positions. Each building was a question. Each doorway was a potential crossfire. The alleys that branched off the avenue on either side were the same alleys that had swallowed warriors for two days, the same corners that produced the same questions, the same dead.

But the answers were different today.

Today, the human defenders were not holding. They were fighting — fiercely, desperately, with the concentrated fury of men and women who knew that the thing behind them was the last thing — but they were not holding the way they had held on Day 5. The positions were undermanned. The crossfire was thinner. The barricades at the junctions were hasty — rubble piled without the engineering that had characterized the earlier defenses, the work of soldiers who had been given minutes instead of hours and who had built what minutes could build.

The human commander was running out of men.

Thokk could feel it the way a hunter felt the quarry tiring — not through a single sign but through the accumulation of signs, the pattern that formed when the individual details aligned. The crossbow fire was sporadic instead of disciplined. The counter-attacks were smaller, faster, the quick strikes of a force that no longer had the mass for sustained engagement. The buildings that should have been fortified were empty, the defenders pulled back to the next position, and the next position was closer than the last, and the closer was the thing that said the shrinking was not strategy but mathematics — the commander did not have enough bodies to hold every building, so he held the ones that mattered, and the ones that mattered were fewer each hour.

The balance was tipping.

Thokk advanced. Building by building. Block by block. The warbands surged around him — Krogan on the avenue, Gharza flanking east, Drekkha's vanguard clearing the buildings that needed clearing. The pattern was the same as Day 5, but the pace was different. Faster. The resistance that had stalled them at every junction for two days was breaking, the human defense contracting as the Ironclaw pressed south, the circle shrinking, the defenders compressing into the space between the last buildings and the gate.

A barricade at the junction of Forge Road and a side street. Five human defenders. They fought. Three Ironclaw died. The five humans died. The barricade was taken.

A forge-shop at the avenue's bend — the large one, the one Malga had reported seeing the commander standing in. Empty. The commander had moved. The forge-shop was a shell — the great anvil warped and cold, the chimney cracked, the roof open to the sky through a gap that let in a column of smoke-filtered light. Thokk passed through it. The anvil was human-made. The forge was human-made. The things the forge had produced — the iron, the steel, the work of the smiths who had died in the firebombing — were everywhere in the district, in the barricade material, in the weapons the defenders carried, in the bolts that killed Ironclaw warriors from arrow slits cut into walls that the dead smiths had built.

The wound that built the wall. Everywhere.

---

He found the gate at midday.

The dormitory wall — the last line of buildings before the inner ring — stretched across the southern edge of the Anvil District in a row of stone structures that had once been worker housing and were now the final barrier. The buildings were thin-walled. Not military construction. Not designed for defense. But the human defenders had done what they had done to every surface in the Anvil: they had turned civilian architecture into fighting positions. Arrow slits in the windows. Rubble barricades in the doorways. The spaces between the buildings sealed with timber and stone to create a continuous wall that was not a wall in any structural sense but was doing the work of one.

Behind the dormitory wall, the gate to the inner ring. Thokk could see it — the dark arch in the inner ring's wall, the heavy timber doors reinforced with iron banding, the gate that separated the Anvil District from the Emberheart. The gate was closed. The gate was the last thing between the Ironclaw and the heart of the city.

The human defenders were in the dormitory buildings. Not many. Thokk could count the arrow slits that had movement behind them, could track the helmets that appeared above the barricades between buildings, could measure the density of the defense by the frequency and direction of the crossbow fire that greeted his vanguard as they advanced into range.

Not many. But enough to hold the position for an hour. Maybe two. Maybe long enough for whatever the commander had planned behind the gate, the final preparation, the last calculation of a mind that had not stopped calculating since Day 1.

The human commander was not at the dormitory wall.

Thokk knew this because the defense, though fierce, lacked the quality that the human commander's presence gave it — the specific, calibrated efficiency that turned a defensive position from good to impregnable, the intelligence that saw every angle and covered every approach and predicted every assault before the assault began. The dormitory wall was being held by soldiers. Good soldiers. Soldiers who fought with the compressed fury of people whose world had shrunk to the size of a building and who had decided that the building was the thing they would die for. But soldiers without the commander's mind.

The commander was behind the gate. In the Emberheart. Or at the gate itself, at the final position, the last wall, waiting for the moment when the Ironclaw broke through the dormitories and poured into the space between the buildings and the gate.

Waiting for Thokk.

The thought arrived with the certainty of the number seven — not understood, not interpreted, but known, the way a body knew the direction of a blow before the blow arrived. The human commander was at the gate. He had been there all along — not at the dormitories, not at the barricades, not at the positions that were designed to bleed the Ironclaw assault. At the gate. The final point. The place where the siege would end.

He was waiting for the Warlord.

And the Warlord was coming.

---

Thokk paused at the edge of the approach.

The warbands were pressing the dormitory wall on three fronts — Krogan's on the avenue, Gharza from the east, Drekkha's vanguard in the centre. The fighting was close and ugly, the particular violence of a position being overrun building by building, room by room, the defenders selling each space at the cost the space demanded and the cost was Ironclaw warriors who died in doorways and stairwells and the tight, compressed spaces where size and strength mattered less than the willingness to take a blade to give a blade.

The dormitory wall was breaking.

Thokk could hear it — the sounds changing, the frequency of the defense shifting from the disciplined, sustained rhythm of a position being held to the fragmented, sporadic rhythm of a position being lost. Individual fights instead of coordinated defense. Screams instead of orders. The sound of the end, which was the same sound in every siege, in every city, the sound that said the wall was not a wall anymore and the men behind it were not behind it anymore and the thing that was coming was coming through.

He stood at the edge and watched.

The tower shield on his left arm. The war-axe in his right hand. The skull at his belt, the empty eye sockets staring south toward the gate the way they had stared at every fire and every wall and every battle Thokk had carried them through. The pouch with the cold wolf knuckle, the bone that had been warm and was not warm and would not be warm again because the fire that warmed it was gone from the world.

The armour that had been his father's — the boar-tusk pauldrons, the iron plates, the leather underlayer that was older than Thokk and had been old when his father wore it. The armour was not ceremonial. It was functional. It had taken hits on six walls and in forty alleys and in the breach at the Sundered Gate and in every place the siege had placed a Warlord's body between the enemy and the warriors behind him. It was dented. It was scored. It was the armour of a man who had not stood behind anything for six days and who would not stand behind anything now.

He thought about the children.

The shore camps at Bloodtide Bay. The fires at the turning of the season. The small faces that looked up when the hunters returned, the question in them that was always the same question — *did you bring enough?* The answer that was always the same answer — *not yet, but tomorrow.* The promise that was always the same promise.

The promise that had brought him here. To a crater in a burned city, standing in the rubble of a barricade his ally had blown, facing a gate that led to a place he did not need to own but needed to take because the taking was the only road to the keeping — the keeping of the children, the keeping of the shore camps, the keeping of the future that the Ironclaw would not have if the wall held and the gate stayed closed and the food ran out and the two winters arrived and the hunting grounds failed.

The children needed to eat.

"Blood-Chief."

Drekkha. At his shoulder. The vanguard behind her — thirty warriors, what remained of Malga's hundred and fifty, the compressed remnant of a force that had gone first through every wall and every door and every junction and had paid the cost of going first in the currency that going first demanded.

"Da dormitory wall is falling. Krogan is through da eastern building. Gharza is flanking da western junction. Da avenue is clear to da gate."

The avenue was clear to the gate.

Thokk looked south. The space between the dormitory wall and the gate was an open courtyard — cobblestones, a dry fountain, the remnants of a market that had been cleared to create a killing ground. Fifty paces. Open. No cover. The gate at the far end, the dark arch, the doors that were the last doors.

In the courtyard, shapes. Human defenders. Not many — a handful, perhaps, the last of the garrison, the survivors of the survivors of a force that had started at eight hundred and fifty and had been ground down by six days of siege to a number that Thokk could count from where he stood.

And one shape that was different.

A man. Standing at the gate. Not behind it — in front of it. Between the doors. A sword in one hand. Armour that was battered and scorched and dented and that bore the marks of six days the way Thokk's armour bore six days — not as damage but as record, as the written history of a siege that had cost both of them everything and was about to cost the last thing.

The human commander.

Thokk knew him the way the gate had known Thokk's hand — not by sight, not by insignia, but by the quality of the standing. The way the man occupied the space. The way the sword hung in his hand, not raised, not lowered, held at the position that said *I am here and I am waiting and the waiting is not passivity but preparation.* The posture of a man who had decided where he would fight and was standing in the place he had decided.

Thokk recognised the posture because it was his own.

The mirror again. The recognition from Day 3, from the Iron Marches, from the wall, from every moment when the human commander's intelligence had met Thokk's intelligence across the distance of a siege and the two minds had measured each other and found the same thing — the same weight, the same cost, the same locked room behind the same ribs, the same children (not children, not literally, but the same thing — the people behind the wall, the people the fighting was for, the reason the fighting continued past the point where the fighting should have stopped).

Two men. Two walls. One gate.

Thokk stepped forward.

The war-axe in his hand. The tower shield on his arm. The skull at his belt. The cold wolf knuckle in its pouch. Six days of dead behind him. The children ahead. The number seven in the empty air where the spirits had been, the echo of a voice that had stopped speaking, the last word from the ancestors pressed through a closing door.

He crossed the rubble. Stepped over the last of the dormitory wall's debris. Entered the courtyard. The cobblestones were slick — rain and blood, the same surface, the same footing that the whole siege had provided, the ground that was never solid because the ground in Bloodhollow was never solid, the ground that shifted and broke and demanded that the men who walked on it earned every step.

The human commander watched him come.

Neither man spoke. There was nothing to say that six days had not already said. The siege had been a conversation between them — move and counter-move, assault and defense, the exchange of warriors' lives in the grammar of a language both men spoke fluently. The conversation was ending. What came next was the period at the end — the final punctuation, the stroke that completed the sentence.

Thokk Ironhide walked toward the gate.

He walked with the stride of a Warlord. Not the ceremonial stride — the theatrical, heavy-footed march that Warlords used in the war camps to project power. The real stride. The one that was fast and balanced and carried the weight of a body that had been built for war and had spent itself in war and was spending the last of itself now, in the final steps of the final approach, the walk that ended where it ended.

The distance between them closed.

Forty paces. Thirty. Twenty.

The human commander's eyes — grey, flat, the colour of the iron he had forged his defense from — tracked Thokk's approach. The sword came up. Not fast. The measured rise of a weapon held by a man who had learned patience from the same teacher Thokk had learned it from — the siege itself, the long education of six days that taught every lesson except mercy.

Thokk raised the war-axe.

The gate was behind the commander. The Emberheart was behind the gate. The future was behind the Emberheart — the food, the land, the resources, the two winters' worth of survival that the Ironclaw needed and that the gate guarded and that the commander defended and that Thokk would take or die trying to take because dying was the Warlord's privilege and the dying was the duty.

He was at the front. Where Warlords belonged.

He was looking for the commander.

He had found him.

He was looking for the end.

It was here.
