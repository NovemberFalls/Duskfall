# Chapter 28 — THE SKULL

## After

---

The skull arrived on the ninth day.

A private brought it — a man Stoneveil did not recognize, which meant the man had come through the service corridor from the Inner Ring, which meant the man had been behind the gate for six days while the people on the other side of it died. The private held the skull at arm's length, the way a man held a thing he did not want to touch but had been ordered to carry, and the ordering had overridden the not-wanting the way orders always did.

"Lord Commander Blackthorn's compliments, sir. He requests this be catalogued with the war trophies for the Council record."

The skull was an orc's. The Warlord's.

Stoneveil looked at it. The bone was clean — scrubbed, bleached, the tissue removed by the Council's morticians with the same efficiency they applied to everything, the conversion of a body into an object, of a man into a record, of the thing that had been Warlord Thokk Ironhide into a piece of administrative inventory. The jaw was missing. The jaw had been broken — Stoneveil's pommel, the sixth strike, the blow that had not felled the orc but had rearranged his face — and the breaking had made the bone unsalvageable, so the morticians had discarded it, and the discarding had turned the skull into something that was not quite the face it had been, the absence of the jaw giving the bone a truncated, incomplete look, the look of a sentence that had been stopped before it was finished.

The eye sockets were dark. The eye sockets were always dark.

"Put it on the anvil," Stoneveil said.

The private hesitated. The hesitation lasted one heartbeat — the quarter-breath, the same pause Captain Harren had made in the firelight six months ago when the order was the incendiaries and the order was clear and the clarity was the cruelty. But the private was not Harren. The private was a man who had been behind the gate, and the hesitation was not moral weight but confusion, the confusion of a man being told to place a war trophy on an anvil in a burned-out forge in a district that was rubble and who did not understand the instruction because the instruction required a context the man did not have.

"The anvil, sir?"

"The anvil."

The private placed the skull on the anvil. The bone sat on the iron surface — the striking surface, the flat, dark face of the metal that had held every heat and every blow that sixty years of forge-work had delivered and had absorbed them all and was cold now, had been cold for six months, would be cold for however long the Anvil District remained a district and the remaining was uncertain because the district had been destroyed three times and the third time had left so little that the word *district* was a courtesy.

The skull sat on the anvil the way all things sat on the anvil. Still. Cold. Waiting for the next strike.

"Dismissed."

The private left. His boots made the sound of a man walking across cobblestones that had been scrubbed but not cleaned, the distinction between the two being the difference between effort and result, and the result was that the stones were still dark in the cracks where the blood had settled and the settling was permanent.

Stoneveil stood in the forge.

---

Blackhand's forge. Still Blackhand's — the name persisted the way names persisted in places of death, the way Ashgate was still Ashgate and the Crimson Docks were still the Crimson Docks and the Anvil was still the Anvil even though the anvil was the only thing remaining from the original structure. The walls had been rebuilt — or rather, shored, the surviving masonry braced with timber and rubble until the building was not a building but a suggestion, the outline of the forge held upright by the materials of other buildings that had not survived even as outlines.

The roof was canvas. Military issue. Stretched across the gap where the chimney stack had been, the gap through which Stoneveil had watched the Forge-King raise his hammer for the last time, the gap that his soldiers had covered because the forge was the command post and the command post required a roof and the requiring was a function and functions were met.

Stoneveil stood at the anvil and looked at the skull.

The skull looked back. The dark sockets held nothing — no recognition, no accusation, no last expression. The morticians had removed everything that made an orc's face a face and left only the architecture, the bone, the structure that had held Thokk Ironhide's thoughts and his grief and his command and the weight of four hundred dead warriors and the children at the shore camps and the spirits that had gone quiet. The structure was intact. The contents were gone.

Stoneveil understood the feeling.

He pressed his left hand against the anvil. The tremor was there. It was always there. It had been there since Day 3, when the holding had started, and the holding had continued through the fighting and the silence after and the nine days since and the tremor had not diminished because the tremor was not a wound that healed. The tremor was a condition. The condition was permanent.

He let it be.

---

The report was due at the tenth bell.

Stoneveil had written reports before. After Ashgate — the three-page document that described the defense of the pass, the loss of six hundred and eighty defenders, the killing of Overseer Brok Drakhold, and the survival of four hundred and twenty. The report had been clean. Precise. The language of military documentation, which was a language designed to contain events within margins, to render the uncontainable into paragraphs and subsections and the specific, controlled prose that allowed a Lord Commander to read about the death of six hundred and eighty people between his morning tea and his noon briefing without the reading disrupting the schedule.

He had written reports after the Anvil. The firebombing. Nine hundred and twelve confirmed dead, the number in the standard font. Forty-three under sixteen, the number in the smaller font, in the column without a heading.

The report had been clean then, too.

He sat at the table that had been placed in the forge — the same kind of table that the clerk had used in the courtyard, the mess-hall table, the flat surface that the machine provided for the conversion of events into records. Paper. Ink. The instruments of documentation, as precise and as lethal in their own way as the sword that leaned against the anvil's base.

He picked up the quill.

*To Lord Commander Aldric Blackthorn, Commander of the Crimsonmarch Forces, Emberfall Garrison.*

*Re: After-Action Report — Defense of Emberfall, Year 99, Days 1-6 (The Blackroot Siege)*

The words came. They always came. The language of the report was the language Stoneveil spoke best — measured, controlled, disciplined, the sentences marching across the page the way soldiers marched across a field, in order, in formation, each word placed beside the next with the precision of a man who understood that language was a wall and walls were what he built.

*Initial garrison strength: 850 combat-effective.*

He wrote the number. The number did not tremble. The hand that held the quill was the right hand, the sword hand, the hand that was steady, and the steadiness produced a number that sat on the page with the quiet authority of a fact that was not aware of its own weight.

*Final garrison strength: 72.*

He wrote that number, too.

The two numbers sat on the page separated by a colon and a space and nine days and seven hundred and seventy-eight people. The space between them was the width of a quill stroke. The distance between them was the distance between a city that functioned and a city that was rubble, between an army and a remnant, between the man who had received the first number and the man who was writing the second.

He continued.

*Enemy forces engaged: estimated 2,500 Ironclaw Orcs, plus goblin siege contingent under Pyrelord Skrixx Blazebinder.*

*Enemy losses: estimated 400+ confirmed kills. Enemy force fragmented following the death of Warlord Thokk Ironhide on Day 6. Goblin siege contingent withdrew north under Blazebinder's command — estimated 46 surviving elements. Blazebinder destroyed his siege engines before withdrawal. His forces remain at large.*

At large. The words that meant *we did not finish it.* The words that meant Skrixx Blazebinder was somewhere in the hills north of Emberfall with forty-six goblins and the mind that had built the engines that had blown the barricades that had killed the men who had held the walls, and the mind was intact because the mind was the kind of thing that survived, the way fire survived — not as a decision but as a definition.

Stoneveil wrote the section on tactical dispositions. The defense of the Sundered Gate. The outer ring — the Iron Marches, the wall positions, the flanking corridors. The fall of the outer ring on Day 4. The retreat to the Anvil District. The barricade positions. The final defense of the courtyard.

The language was clean. The sentences were ordered. The report described six days of siege in the grammar of military documentation, each engagement rendered into its component parts — units engaged, positions held, positions lost, casualties sustained, materiel expended — the events of the siege disassembled and reassembled in the format that the Lord Commander's desk required, the format that converted war into administration and administration into history and history into the thing that sat on shelves and gathered dust and was occasionally consulted by officers who wanted to understand how a garrison of eight hundred and fifty had held a city against two thousand five hundred and the understanding was in the numbers and the numbers were the thing that Stoneveil wrote and the writing was the easiest part because the numbers did not require him to think about what the numbers meant.

He reached the final section.

*Conclusion.*

The quill stopped.

Not because he did not know what to write. He knew exactly what to write. The conclusion was the section where the commanding officer assessed the outcome — victory or defeat, strategic significance, recommendations for future operations. The conclusion was where the report told the Lord Commander what the Lord Commander wanted to hear: that the defense had been successful, that the gate had held, that the sacrifice of seven hundred and seventy-eight people had purchased the continued existence of Emberfall and the Emberheart and the Lord Commander's office and the Lord Commander's morning tea.

*The city held.*

He wrote it. Three words. The words that Blackthorn would read and nod at and file and reference in his own report to the Council, the report that would describe the siege as a victory and the victory as evidence of the garrison's capability and the capability as justification for the strategy of concentric defense that had been Stoneveil's doctrine and Blackthorn's authorization and the Council's approval.

The city held.

The cost was everything.

He did not write the second sentence. The second sentence was not the kind of sentence that appeared in reports. The second sentence was the kind of sentence that lived behind the ribs, in the space where the arithmetic ran, in the room where the forty-three pressed against the door that was not a door anymore because the door had opened on Day 5 when he stood in the forge and the forge was the place where the forty-three had died and the place was where he was sitting now, writing a report about the next set of dead, the five hundred and three and the four hundred and the Warlord, the numbers piling against the door that was open and the open door was the condition and the condition was permanent.

He set down the quill.

He looked at the skull on the anvil.

---

The skull had been hanging from the Warlord's belt.

Stoneveil remembered this. The chain. The weight. The skull of the previous Warlord, carried as proof of succession, as title, as the orc version of the brass insignia and the crossed swords and the commendations that the Council awarded for the efficient destruction of things. The Warlord had carried the skull the way Stoneveil carried the report — as evidence. As documentation. As the weight of what command required, made visible, made physical, hung from the body so the body never forgot what the carrying cost.

Now Stoneveil had a skull.

Not the same skull — not the old Warlord's skull that Thokk had carried. That skull had been removed by the morticians along with the rest of the remains, catalogued, filed, entered into the system that processed war's wreckage into the empire's records. This skull was Thokk's. This skull was the one Blackthorn wanted on display in the Council chamber, behind glass, with a small placard that read *Warlord Thokk Ironhide, killed in single combat by Warden Alric Stoneveil at the Battle of Emberfall, Year 99.*

The placard would not mention the seven strikes. The placard would not mention the recognition in the dark eyes, the moment when two men who had been fighting the same war from opposite sides of a wall had looked at each other and understood that the looking was the only honest thing the war had produced. The placard would not mention that Thokk had died standing because standing was the posture of command and command did not end when the body ended.

The placard would say *killed.* The placard would say *victory.* The placard would be clean.

Stoneveil looked at the skull and the skull looked at nothing and the nothing was the thing they shared.

He stood. The motion was the motion of a man who had been sitting too long in a place that did not permit sitting — not because the chair was uncomfortable but because the place was the forge and the forge was the place and the place was the thing that pressed against him from every direction, the walls that had been rebuilt from the walls that had burned from the walls he had ordered burned, the layers of destruction stacked on each other like the layers of residue on his sword, each one the record of a thing he had done and the record was the cost and the cost was the condition.

He walked to the entrance.

---

The Anvil District was quiet.

Not the silence of the siege's end — that silence had been the silence of exhaustion, the absence of noise produced by the spending of everything that made noise. This was different. This was the silence of aftermath. The silence of a place that had been emptied and was learning what emptiness sounded like, the specific acoustic of rubble and ash and the spaces between the standing walls where the wind moved through and the moving produced a sound that was not quite a whistle and not quite a moan but the thing between the two, the sound that ruins made when the ruins were left alone.

The wind moved through the Anvil.

Stoneveil walked north along Forge Road. The road was cleared — his engineers had shifted the rubble to the sides, creating a passage wide enough for supply carts and casualty details and the administrative machinery that the Inner Ring was extending into the district now that the district was safe, the safety being relative, the safety meaning that the things which killed in the district were no longer swords and siege engines but unstable masonry and the structural failure of buildings that had been burned and shelled and burned again and were held upright by nothing except the inertia of stone.

The barricade positions were being dismantled. The northern barricade — the one built from the black, scorched masonry of the firebombing — was half-gone, the stones being pulled apart by work crews and stacked for reconstruction, the wall becoming raw material again, the cycle completing, the rubble that had been a building that had been rubble that had been a barricade becoming rubble again because rubble was the natural state of the Anvil and everything else was temporary.

He walked past the junction where the mass graves had been dug. The graves were covered now — earth mounded over the trenches, the surface tamped flat by the boots of the men who had filled them. No markers. The markers would come later, if they came at all. The dead were in the records — Veyne's slate, the clerk's forms, the administration of absence — and the records were the markers and the markers were paper and paper was the thing the empire used to remember and the remembering was a function and functions were performed.

He walked to the Sundered Gate.

The gate that had never fallen. The gate that was his name, his title, his identity for twenty years — the Warden of the Sundered Gate, the man who held the entrance, the man whose purpose was the gate and whose purpose had been fulfilled because the gate stood and the standing was the victory and the victory was the thing that the report described and the report was on the table in the forge behind him, unsigned, incomplete, the conclusion half-written, the three words that said the city held and the silence where the cost should have been.

He stood at the gate.

The Sundered Gate was damaged but intact. The dwarven stonework had absorbed the siege the way the anvil absorbed heat — through mass, through density, through the fundamental stubbornness of material that had been shaped by hands that understood stone the way Stoneveil understood walls, the understanding that the thing you built was always stronger than the thing that hit it if you built it correctly. The rune-wards along the archway were dark. They had been dark since Day 3, the enchantments spent, the magic that the War-Mages had woven into the stone exhausted by the sustained bombardment. But the stone held. The stone did not require magic. The stone required nothing except itself.

Beyond the gate — the outer ring. Rubble. The Iron Marches, destroyed. The wall positions, collapsed. The district that had been the first line of defense was a landscape of destruction so complete that the destruction had become the terrain, the rubble indistinguishable from the ground, the ground indistinguishable from the waste, the waste stretching to the outer wall and beyond, to the hills where the Ironclaw had camped and from which the Ironclaw had retreated and which were empty now except for the burned remains of Skrixx's siege engines and the shallow graves the orcs had dug for their own dead.

Beyond the hills — the horizon. Grey. The Bloodhollow sky, pressing down on the landscape with the weight of a world that had been fighting for a decade and was not finished fighting and would not be finished because the world was Bloodhollow and Bloodhollow was the place where gods had left and people remained and the remaining was war and the war was the condition and the condition was permanent.

Stoneveil stood at the gate and looked at the horizon and felt nothing.

Not the absence of feeling — the other thing. The thing beyond feeling, the state that occurred when feeling had been sustained at such intensity and for such duration that the mechanism wore through and what remained was not numbness but a void, a space where feeling had been, the cavity that remained when the thing that filled it was consumed. He had felt this at Ashgate. He had felt this after the Anvil. He recognized it the way he recognized the tremor — as a condition, as a consequence, as the thing that happened to the men who gave the orders and watched the orders executed and survived the execution.

The wind moved through the gate.

He looked at his hands.

The right hand — steady. The sword hand. The hand that had held the blade at Ashgate and at the Crimson Docks and in the courtyard where the Warlord's blood had pooled in the cracks. The hand that had written reports and signed orders and given the signal for the incendiaries that had arced through the smoke and burst on the barricades below. The hand that worked.

The left hand — trembling. The hand that did not work. The hand that had not been steady since Day 3 and would not be steady again because the steadiness had been spent the way everything had been spent, the reserve consumed, the mechanism damaged in a way that did not repair. The hand that he pressed against anvils and thighs and the flat surfaces of walls to absorb the vibration, the vibration that was not pain but information, the body's way of telling him what the body already knew and the mind refused to acknowledge.

He looked at the left hand.

The blood was not there. The blood had been washed — he had washed it himself, on Day 7, standing at the cistern in the courtyard, scrubbing the dried residue from his skin with the methodical, thorough attention he applied to equipment maintenance. The skin was clean. The nails were clean. The lines of the palm were clean.

The blood was still there.

Not the blood from the siege — the siege blood had washed. The blood from the Anvil. From the firebombing. From the night when nine hundred and twelve people had burned and forty-three of them had been under sixteen and the burning had been his order and the order had been correct and the correctness was the thing that would not wash because the correctness was the stain, the permanent mark that the hand carried not on its surface but in its structure, in the muscle and the bone and the memory that the muscle and the bone contained.

The blood that won't wash off.

He had known a commander once — a man at the Crimson Docks, a naval officer, a man who had ordered the scuttling of a refugee ship to prevent it falling into pirate hands. Forty passengers. The officer had scrubbed his hands for three hours after. Had worn through the skin. Had been found at dawn with his hands in a bucket of salt water, the water pink, the skin raw, the man scrubbing because the scrubbing was the only response the body had to a stain that was not on the body.

Stoneveil had not scrubbed.

He had washed. Once. Thoroughly. And then he had stopped because the stopping was the acknowledgment and the acknowledgment was this: the blood was not on the hands. The blood was in the hands. The blood was the hands. The hands had given the order and the order had produced the blood and the blood had gone into the hands the way the heat had gone into the anvil, permanently, structurally, the material absorbing the consequence until the consequence was part of the material and the material was part of the man and the man was the Warden of the Sundered Gate who had held the city by destroying it and had destroyed it by holding it and the holding and the destroying were the same action performed twice, six months apart, in the same district, with the same hands.

---

He walked back to the forge.

The skull sat on the anvil. The dark sockets. The clean bone. The trophy that Blackthorn wanted behind glass with a placard that said *victory.*

Stoneveil sat at the table. He picked up the quill. He looked at the conclusion.

*The city held.*

The three words on the page. The three words that were true. The three words that would be filed and referenced and cited in the histories that would be written about the Blackroot Siege by men who had not been present and whose absence from the present would allow them to write about it with the clarity that presence did not permit.

He dipped the quill.

*The gate was not breached. The Emberheart was not threatened. The garrison fulfilled its mandate.*

The language of completion. The language that said: the thing you asked us to do, we did. The cost is in the attached casualty report. The cost is in the numbers. The cost is in the column that has a heading and the column that does not.

He signed the report. His name — *Warden Alric Stoneveil* — written in the same controlled hand that had written every report, every order, every document that bore his authority and his responsibility and the weight of the things his authority had authorized and his responsibility had required.

He set down the quill.

He looked at the skull.

The skull looked at nothing.

The two of them sat in the forge that had been Blackhand's and was now Stoneveil's and was now no one's — the forge that had been a forge and a fortress and a pyre and a command post and a ruin and was now a room with a table and a skull and a man who had held a city by destroying it twice and who was sitting in the wreckage of the holding with the report signed and the conclusion written and the numbers filed and the blood in his hands and the tremor in his left and the silence in the space where the answer should have been.

Was it worth it?

The question arrived the way the tremor arrived — unbidden, persistent, the thing that pressed from the inside against the thing that held. The question that had been pressing since the firebombing, since the incendiaries, since the third bell when the Anvil began to burn. The question that the siege had amplified and the silence had not diminished. The question that sat behind the numbers and the reports and the language of completion, the question that the language was designed to contain and could not contain because the question was larger than the language and the containing was a wall and the question was the thing that walls could not hold.

Was it worth it?

Seven hundred and seventy-eight dead to hold a gate. Nine hundred and twelve dead to hold a district. Thokk Ironhide dead to hold a courtyard. Forty-three children dead to hold an order.

Was it worth it?

The question did not have an answer. The question was not designed to have an answer. The question was designed to be asked, to sit in the space behind the ribs where the numbers lived, to press against the door that was open now and would not close, to be the sound that the silence made when a man sat alone in the ruins of the thing he had saved and the saving was the destroying and the destroying was the saving and the two were the same and the sameness was the answer and the answer was not an answer.

Stoneveil sat in the forge.

The wind moved through the Anvil District. Through the gaps in the shored walls. Through the cleared avenue. Through the Sundered Gate. The wind carried the ash that the district still produced — the fine, grey particulate of a place that had burned and was still releasing the burning, atom by atom, into the air, the district exhaling the last of its dead into the wind that carried them over the walls and into the hills and across the landscape of Bloodhollow where the dead went when the dead were done being carried by the living.

The skull sat on the anvil.

The report sat on the table.

The Warden of the Sundered Gate sat in the silence of a city he had held and the holding was the weight and the weight was the hands and the hands trembled, the left one, always the left one, the tremor that was not a wound but a record, the body's documentation of the cost, the involuntary, permanent, unerasable notation that said: you held the city. You held the gate. You held the order and the fire and the seven strikes and the seventy-two survivors.

You held everything.

And the holding cost you the thing that the holding was for.

The wind moved through the ruins.

The silence was the sound of wind through stone.

It was the only answer the Anvil had left to give.
