# Chapter 16 — INSIDE THE WALLS

---

The outer ring smelled like a slaughterhouse left open in the sun.

Thokk walked through the Iron Marches with the skull at his belt and the cracked wolf knuckle in his pouch and the weight of four days pressing down on his shoulders like stone. The district was his now. The math said so. The dead said so. The silence where the human horns had been said so.

He did not feel like a conqueror.

The street was Forge Road. He knew this because a sign hung from a bent iron bracket above what had once been a doorway, the letters human-Common but legible: *Forge Road — Southern Section*. Below the sign, two orc warriors sat with their backs against the wall, passing a waterskin between them. One had a bandage wrapped around his head so thick it covered his left eye. The other was missing three fingers on his right hand, the stumps blackened with cauterizing pitch.

They saw Thokk and started to rise.

"Sit," he said.

They sat. The one with the bandage held up the waterskin in offering. Thokk shook his head and kept walking.

The buildings on Forge Road were human-made. Stone and iron, squat and functional, built for industry rather than beauty. Workshops. Storage. Barracks with narrow windows designed for archers. Most of them were damaged — walls cratered from catapult impacts, roofs caved where alchemist's fire had done its work, doorways choked with rubble. The humans had fought from these buildings during the retreat. Thokk could see the evidence: arrow slits in shuttered windows, barricade material dragged into doorways then abandoned, blood trails leading inward where wounded had crawled to die in the dark.

Some of those buildings still held their dead. He could smell them. The heat of Day 4's sun was doing its work, and the iron district held the warmth like a forge. Bodies that had been men and orcs that morning were becoming something else by afternoon.

Grimtusk walked beside him. The old shaman moved slowly, his copper-capped tusks catching the light where it broke through the smoke haze. His milky grey eyes tracked things Thokk could not see — spirit-traces, maybe, or the residue of the dying. Since the breach at dawn, Grimtusk had said almost nothing. That silence was louder than any bone reading.

"How many?" Thokk asked.

He did not specify. He did not need to.

"Forty-one Ironclaw since da sun came up," Grimtusk said. "Seventeen goblins. Da breach cost heavy. Da street fighting cost heavier."

Forty-one. Added to the one hundred and sixty-seven before today. Two hundred and eight Ironclaw warriors dead in four days.

The number sat in the locked room behind his ribs, beside the food count and the water count and the number of warriors who could still hold a weapon and swing it. The locked room was getting crowded.

"Da goblin charges?" Thokk said.

"Three tunnels blew. Skrixx lost two full sapper teams in da western detonation — fourteen goblins, buried or burned. Da eastern charges misfired. Two more dead." Grimtusk paused. "Skrixx is not mourning. He is counting what's left to blow."

That was Skrixx. The goblin did not grieve. He calculated. Loss was a variable in the equation, not a wound in the chest.

"And da Revenants?"

"Untouched. Five hundred."

Thokk said nothing. The Revenants had gone through the breach after the Ironclaw cleared it — stumbling through rubble, filling the gap with their rotting bodies and their ancient weapons, holding the ground the living had paid for. They did not tire. They did not fear. They did not die, because they were already dead.

They also did not care. The Ironclaw fought for the future. The goblins fought for profit and fire. The Revenants fought because something older than purpose drove them forward, something Thokk did not understand and Grimtusk would not name.

Five hundred bodies that felt nothing. Thokk had used them to hold the breach while the Ironclaw rested. It was efficient. It was necessary.

It sat wrong in his gut like bad meat.

---

They passed a square where two streets met. The humans had made a stand here — Thokk could read the battle like tracks in snow. A barricade of overturned carts and forge timbers, hastily constructed. Arrow gouges in the stone walls at head height, clustered in patterns that said disciplined volley fire. Blood pooled where the barricade had been breached, soaked into the gaps between the paving stones.

The barricade was broken now. Shattered by Ironclaw weight and fury. But the blood on the human side of it was thin — not many had fallen here. They had held, then pulled back. Fighting withdrawal. Ordered, controlled, the kind of retreat that cost the attacker more than the defender.

The human commander.

Thokk stopped at the barricade. Picked up a broken spear shaft, human-made, good ash wood with iron banding. Snapped clean at the midpoint where an axe had hit it. He turned it over in his hands, feeling the weight, the balance. Well-made. The humans forged good weapons. Not as good as dwarf-work, but honest steel and honest wood, built by smiths who knew their trade.

The smiths this commander had burned six months ago. Thokk knew about the Anvil revolt — scouts had reported it, War-Chiefs had discussed it, Gharza had called it a gift. *Da commander who burns his own people is a commander with cracks,* she had said. *Cracks widen under pressure.*

But the cracks had not widened. Not the way Gharza predicted. The human commander fought like a man with nothing left to lose and everything left to protect, and those were the most dangerous warriors on any field. Thokk had known men like that. He had been that man, once, in the months after his wife died and the only thing keeping him upright was the knowledge that the children still needed to eat.

The children needed to eat.

He dropped the spear shaft and kept walking.

---

Krogan found him at the eastern bastion.

The War-Chief looked worse than he had two days ago. The scalp wound from Day 2 was healing — the black gut stitches holding — but his face was the colour of old ash beneath the green. Grey in the hollows of his eyes. Grey in the lines around his mouth. His eldest son's death had done more damage than any human blade.

"Eastern bastion is ours," Krogan said. His voice was flat, the words laid down like stones. "Cleaned out da last pocket an hour ago. Twelve humans who wouldn't surrender. Dey fought in da stairwell. Tight space. Killed three of mine before we put dem down."

"Prisoners?"

"None from da bastion. Da ones who surrendered at da wall — thirty-two. Mostly wounded. Some won't last da night."

Thirty-two prisoners. Wounded humans. Mouths to feed from supplies that were already stretched thin — four days of march ration left, maybe five if the scouts found game.

"Feed dem," Thokk said. "Same ration as ours."

Krogan's jaw tightened. Not disagreement — acknowledgment that this would cost. But he said nothing against it. Krogan understood. You treated prisoners the way you wanted your own treated when the balance shifted. And in four days of siege, Thokk had learned that the balance in Bloodhollow was always shifting.

"Da western breach?" Thokk asked.

"Holding. Malga's got a hundred warriors on rotation — fifty in da breach, fifty resting. Da Revenants are filling da line along da northern wall." Krogan paused, and the pause had a shape to it. "Malga's arm is worse."

Thokk had seen it. The wound she had taken on Day 2 had never properly closed. Three days of raising that arm to give orders, to swing a weapon, to point at something that needed killing — three days of tearing the same cut open every time it tried to heal. The shaman wraps were soaked through again. Malga said nothing about it. She would say nothing about it until the arm fell off or the siege ended, whichever came first.

"She fights?"

"She fights," Krogan confirmed. "She's Malga."

That was true. It was also not a plan. But Thokk had no replacement for Malga Bonefist, and pulling her from the line would cost more in morale than her wound cost in blood.

"Da gate?" Thokk said.

Krogan gestured north. "Standing. Like it's been standing for a hundred years and plans to stand for a hundred more."

---

The Sundered Gate.

Thokk walked toward it through the debris field that had been the Veil's Throat — the killing corridor between the two bastions. The ground was carpeted with the dead. Ironclaw warriors who had charged the gate on Days 2 and 3, their bodies still lying where they fell because no one had time to move them. Sixty, maybe seventy. Some had been there long enough that the flies had found them.

The Throat was fifty feet wide and two hundred feet long, flanked by bastion walls that rose four stories on either side. Murder holes above — dark openings in the stone where archers and oil-pourers had crouched. The corridor was designed to funnel attackers into a channel of death, and it had done its job. Every ram crew Thokk had sent in had been destroyed. Four crews. Each one had reached the gate. None had lived to swing more than twice.

The Throat was quiet now. The murder holes were empty. The defenders had pulled back. But the stones remembered — oil stains on the walls, scorch marks where alchemist's fire had splashed from above, the stink of burned flesh so deep in the rock that rain would not wash it out.

Thokk walked the length of the Throat. His boots crunched on spent arrows and broken shields. He stepped over bodies — orc and goblin both, some tangled together in the positions they had died in, reaching for throats that would never be found. The smell was a physical thing, a weight in the air, and Thokk breathed through it because a Warlord did not flinch from what his orders had produced.

These were his dead. Every one of them was his decision.

He reached the gate.

The Sundered Gate rose forty feet above the killing floor. Black iron, bolted to stone, the seams between plates sealed with something that might have been dwarf-forged bonding compound. The rune-wards were still visible — faint now, the blue-white lattice dimmed to a pale ghost of what it had been, but present. Glowing in the gaps between the iron plates like veins of cold fire.

The gate had not fallen.

Thokk stood before it and looked up. The iron was scarred — ram strikes, axe blows, the impact craters of catapult stones — but unbreached. The hinges, each one as thick as Thokk's thigh, were bent but holding. The locking bar behind the gate, visible through a gap where a plate had been dented inward, was a single piece of black iron the length of a wagon.

Four days. Four ram crews. Sixty dead in the Throat. And the gate stood.

Thokk put his hand on the iron. It was warm from the day's heat, rough with corrosion and old damage. Under his palm, he could feel a faint vibration — the wards, still active, pushing back against the touch of something they were built to resist. He was the enemy. The gate knew it.

He took his hand away.

"Dwarves built dis," Grimtusk said from behind him.

"Yah."

"Dey built it to stand forever."

"Nothing stands forever."

"Da dwarves thought different."

Thokk turned from the gate and looked south, through the archway where the Throat opened into the Iron Marches behind it. The view was rubble and smoke and the distant shapes of Ironclaw warriors picking through the ruins. But beyond that — past the broken workshops and the shattered barracks and the streets that smelled like death — the middle ring's wall rose.

The Anvil District.

It was shorter than the outer wall. Thinner. Built for industry, not siege. But the humans had been busy. Thokk could see it from here — barricade work along the top, the glint of helmets moving in the gaps, the organized motion of a garrison that had lost a third of its strength and was already preparing to fight for the next line.

The human commander was in there. Standing in the district he had burned six months ago, using the ruins of his own atrocity as barricades. Thokk did not know the specifics — did not know about the forge or the Forge-King or the forty-three — but he knew the shape of it. A man who had destroyed something and was now hiding behind the wreckage. There was a word for that in orcish. *Ghar-rukk.* The wound that builds the wall.

"He's reorganizing," Thokk said.

Grimtusk stood beside him, following his gaze. "Yah. Already."

"How long since da breach?"

"Six hours. Maybe seven."

Seven hours. In seven hours, the human commander had pulled his surviving forces through two retreat routes, established a new defensive line on a wall that was never meant to be a defensive line, repositioned his remaining war-mages, and was already fortifying. Thokk could see the work happening in real time — the distant figures moving with the desperate efficiency of men who knew that stopping meant dying.

Seven hours. Thokk's own forces were still clearing the outer ring.

He respected this. The word sat in his chest the way a swallowed stone sits in the belly — hard, indigestible, impossible to ignore. Not the respect of songs. Not the respect warriors gave to worthy enemies before killing them, the kind that made for good stories around the fire. This was the other kind. The recognition that the man on the other side of the wall was doing the same thing Thokk was doing — spending everything he had to keep his people alive one more day — and doing it well.

The difference between them was geography. It had always been geography.

If Thokk had been born behind that wall, he would be standing on it right now, counting his dead, planning his next defense. If the human commander had been born on Bloodtide Bay, he would be standing where Thokk stood, looking at the next wall and doing the arithmetic.

The same arithmetic. The same cost. The same locked room behind the ribs where the numbers lived.

It made what came next worse. Because what came next was simple: Thokk would send his warriors against that wall, and more of them would die, and more of the humans would die, and the district beyond would become another charnel field, and Thokk would walk through it the way he was walking through this one — counting, grieving, carrying the weight — and the only difference would be that the numbers would be worse.

And then there would be one more wall. The inner ring. The Emberheart.

And then, if the spirits were kind and the bones were right and the cost was not more than the Ironclaw could bear, it would be over.

But the spirits were not kind. The spirits had gone quiet. And the bones showed the number seven, and Grimtusk did not know what it meant, and Thokk had stopped asking.

---

He found Gharza at the western breach.

The gap in the wall was thirty feet wide, the edges ragged where Skrixx's charges had torn the stone apart. Rubble filled the base of the breach in a slope of broken masonry and twisted iron — the remains of the wall's internal reinforcement, the human-forged rebar that had held the stone together for a century until goblin fire found the weakness underneath.

Gharza sat on a chunk of wall stone the size of a cart, her legs dangling over the edge, her axe across her knees. The scar from chin to ear caught the fading light. She was unwounded — still — and the absence of wounds sat on her like a debt she had not yet paid.

"Warlord," she said. Not a greeting. An acknowledgment.

"Report."

"Western flank is ours. Da humans pulled out clean — dey left a rear guard at dat intersection." She pointed south, toward a crossing of streets where Thokk could see the remains of another barricade. "Four men. Held us for twenty minutes. Killed nine."

Four men. Nine Ironclaw dead. The arithmetic of chokepoints and discipline.

"Survivors?"

"From da rear guard? No. Dey didn't come to survive." Gharza spat over the edge of the stone. "Dey came to buy time. Dey bought it."

Thokk looked at the intersection. Four men who knew they were dead the moment they turned to fight. Four men who chose that death so that the column behind them could reach the next wall. He did not know their names. He did not need to. He knew what they were — the same thing his own warriors were when he asked them to hold a breach or charge a gate. Expendable. Valuable. Both at once.

"Da wall?" Thokk said, nodding toward the Anvil District.

"Shorter dan da outer. Thinner. But dey've got barricade work going on top, and I can see at least two ballista positions being set up." Gharza's eyes narrowed. "Dat commander doesn't stop."

"No."

"Dis isn't going to be like da outer ring, Warlord. Da outer ring, we had tunnels and wards to break and two flanks to pressure. Dat wall" — she pointed at the Anvil's northern face — "is one straight line. No flanks. No tunnels. Just stone and whatever's behind it."

Thokk had already done this arithmetic. The Anvil District's wall was a straight line running east to west, anchored at both ends where it met the inner ring's wall at sharp angles. No flanking was possible without breaching the inner ring first, which would mean bypassing the Anvil entirely and fighting through to the Emberheart — a longer, more exposed approach with no cover and the full weight of the remaining war-mages bearing down.

One approach. Straight at the wall. Over or through.

"Skrixx has charges left?" Thokk asked.

"Some. He's being careful wit what's left. Says he can blow one section, maybe two, but da wall's foundations are deeper here. Older stone. He wants to survey before he commits."

"Tell him he has until dawn."

Gharza nodded. Then she looked at Thokk with the expression she wore when she was about to say something he did not want to hear. The scar pulled her mouth into something that was not quite a smile.

"Da food," she said.

"I know."

"Four days. Maybe five if da scouts find something. Dey won't find anything — da valley's been picked clean."

"I know."

"So we're on a clock, Warlord. Whatever dat wall costs, we pay it fast or we pay it hungry. And hungry armies don't climb walls."

Thokk looked at the Anvil District's wall. The helmets moving along the top. The barricade work. The ballista positions taking shape. The human commander, somewhere behind that wall, doing the same arithmetic Thokk was doing — counting days, counting food, counting warriors — and arriving at the same conclusion: this had to end soon.

"Dawn," Thokk said. "We go at dawn."

---

The pyres burned behind the ridge that night. Two hundred and eight Ironclaw dead in four days. The number was too large for individual rites — Thokk had walked among them at sunset, the bone-ash paste warm in the copper bowl, the three-line marks on each forehead, the fist over each heart, but the words had blurred together. Not because he did not care. Because there were too many dead and the same grief could not hold two hundred and eight shapes without breaking.

He stood at the command fire and watched the pyres burn. The smoke climbed into a sky the colour of old iron, carrying the spirits of his warriors toward whatever waited beyond. If anything waited beyond. The spirits had been quiet for two days now. Grimtusk's bones showed nothing but the number seven and the blood that flowed in every direction and the ground that drank it.

Grimtusk sat across the fire, his milky eyes reflecting the flames. The wolf knuckles were in his hands, but he was not reading them. He was holding them the way a man holds a tool that no longer works — with the memory of function, the habit of reaching for it, and the hollow space where the answer used to live.

"Da spirits," Thokk said.

"Still quiet."

"Dat normal? Four days of dying and dey go quiet?"

Grimtusk was silent for a long time. The fire crackled. Somewhere in the camp, a warrior was singing — low, tuneless, the kind of song soldiers sang when they were too tired to sleep and too wound up to be still.

"No," Grimtusk said. "It's not normal. Dis much dying should make dem loud. Should make dem angry. Da dead are supposed to push back against da living, remind us dat da cost is real." He turned the wolf knuckles over in his scarred hands. "Dey're not pushing back. Dey're... pulling away. Like da roots are too thin to hold."

Roots in bad soil.

"What does dat mean for tomorrow?"

Grimtusk looked at him. The milky eyes held something that might have been fear, if the old shaman still remembered what fear felt like.

"It means da rites still work. For now. But da channel is narrow and getting narrower. If too many die too fast..." He trailed off. The silence said the rest.

"Den we make it quick," Thokk said. "One push. Over da wall or through it. Before da channel closes."

He did not know if channels could close. He did not know if the spirit world worked that way. But the metaphor fit, and in the absence of answers, a metaphor was better than nothing.

The skull at his belt caught the firelight. The old Warlord's empty eye sockets stared at the flames, seeing nothing, knowing everything. The endless chain. One Warlord carrying the skull of the last, walking the same ground, fighting the same wars, making the same choices that crushed the same locked rooms behind the same ribs.

The children needed to eat.

Two hundred and forty-nine dead, and the number was not finished. The wall ahead was shorter but the men behind it were harder, compressed by loss into something dense and sharp, the way steel became a blade under the hammer.

Thokk looked south, toward the Anvil District's wall. The fires along its top — torches, braziers — formed a line of defiance against the dark. The human commander was awake. Thokk was sure of it. Two men on opposite sides of a wall that was going to bleed them both dry, and neither could stop because stopping meant the children did not eat.

He reached into the pouch at his belt. The cracked wolf knuckle was warm — not from his body heat, but from something else. The spiritual charge that Grimtusk said was fading but was not yet gone. The bone beside the skull. The weight of what was coming beside the weight of what came before.

"Tomorrow," he said to no one. To the fire. To the dead. To the wall he could not see in the dark but could feel, the way you feel a wound before the blade arrives.

The dark came in behind him.
