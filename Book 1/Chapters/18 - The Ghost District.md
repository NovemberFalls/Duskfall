# CHAPTER EIGHTEEN: THE GHOST DISTRICT

## Day 5 — The Anvil

---

The forge was cold when he woke.

He had not intended to sleep. The intention had been to remain at the command post through the night, standing, assessing, receiving reports from the section commanders who were building his barricades from the rubble of the district he had destroyed. The intention had been discipline. The intention had been function.

His body had overridden the intention at some point between the third and fourth bells. He knew this because Veyne's slate, propped against the anvil's base, showed a series of entries written in her hand rather than dictated — entries covering a ninety-minute gap in which the Warden of the Sundered Gate had sat down against the forge wall and stopped being awake, and the stopping had not been a decision but a failure, the same kind of failure that occurred in mechanisms when the load exceeded the capacity and the mechanism did not break but simply ceased to function until the load redistributed.

Ninety minutes. His first sleep since Day 2.

He stood. The motion was slower than it should have been — the muscles unlocking in the wrong order, the joints protesting the stone floor and the cold and the particular, deep-tissue stiffness of a man who had been standing for the better part of five days and whose body had used its ninety minutes of unconsciousness not to rest but to seize, every fibre contracting in the absence of the will that had kept them extended.

The forge-hall was grey. Dawn light filtered through the collapsed section of roof — the gap where the central chimney stack had folded inward during the firebombing, the opening through which Stoneveil had watched the Forge-King raise his hammer for the last time. The light came through at an angle that turned the interior into a study of ash and shadow, the great anvil at the centre catching the grey and holding it the way the anvil held everything: cold, permanent, unchanged by the thing that rested on its surface.

He looked at his hands.

The right — the sword hand — was functional. The callus between thumb and forefinger had blistered and the blister had broken and the broken skin had dried into a crust that pulled when he flexed, but the grip was there. The grip was always there. The grip was the last thing that failed.

The left hand trembled.

He pressed it flat against the anvil. The iron absorbed the vibration. The iron was good at absorbing things.

"Captain."

Veyne appeared from the entrance. Not appeared — she had been there, he understood, the way she had been there for five days, the way the wall was there, the way the stone was there. A constant. She had not slept either, or she had slept in the same ninety-minute fragments that the siege permitted, her body performing the same override, her slate balanced on her chest in the guard post the way it balanced everywhere — like a child, like a weapon, like the one thing she could not set down because setting it down would mean the numbers stopped updating and the numbers did not stop.

"Status."

"The barricades are complete. Northern approach — three positions across the main avenue, angled to create a crossfire corridor. Eastern approach — two positions along Forge Road, using the collapsed buildings as support. The western access is sealed — Sergeant Dorran's engineers brought down the Smelter's Row overhang. It's rubble from wall to wall. Nothing comes through without climbing."

"The forge-shops?"

"Converted. The four intact buildings along the northern wall are defensive positions now. Arrow slits cut into the masonry. The interiors cleared for fall-back points." Veyne paused. The pause was not hesitation — it was the act of selecting information from the list and presenting it in the order the situation demanded. "The civilian shelters are in the southern buildings. Behind the secondary barricade. The refugees from the outer ring — the women, the children, the wounded who can't fight — they're concentrated in the old apprentice quarters and the worker dormitories."

The apprentice quarters. The worker dormitories. The cramped rooms above the forge-shops where the labourers had slept in shifts because there were never enough beds. The rooms that had been occupied when the incendiaries fell. The rooms that had burned.

Stoneveil filed this. Filed it the way he filed everything — in the operational ledger, in the column that tracked the current, in the present tense where the past was irrelevant and the only number that mattered was the next one.

"Effective strength."

"Four hundred and ninety-one."

Twenty-one fewer than yesterday. Twenty-one who had been combat-effective when the retreat ended and were not combat-effective now — dead from wounds that the surgeons could not close, dead from the slow bleeding that continued after the sutures, dead from the particular, insidious attrition that occurred not on the wall but in the hours after, when the body's reserves ran out and the damage that adrenaline had masked became the damage that killed.

Four hundred and ninety-one.

The number went into the ledger. Not beside the forty-three — the forty-three had their own room, their own door, their own lock that the night had loosened and the morning had not tightened. The four hundred and ninety-one went where the operational numbers went: behind his ribs, in the space where the arithmetic ran, where the projections updated, where the countdown continued its patient, grinding work.

"Supply status."

"Arrows at forty-three per cent. Bolts at thirty-nine. Alchemy spent — the last of the oil was used sealing the western access. We have fire-pots for the barricade positions. Maybe two volleys."

"Food?"

"Grain at fifty-one per cent. Salt meat at forty-four. Water stable — the Anvil District's cisterns are intact. The bombardment hasn't reached the pipes."

"The Emberheart?"

"No communication from Lord Commander Blackthorn."

The sentence arrived with the same weight it had carried on Day 3, and Day 4, and every day since the siege began. No communication. No reserves. No Ironbound Guard descending from the Inner Ring with their enchanted weapons and their polished discipline to reinforce the line that was holding by arithmetic and stubbornness and the particular, grinding refusal of five hundred men to accept the answer the numbers were providing.

No help. The word Stoneveil did not use because the word implied expectation, and expectation was a resource he had stopped spending on Day 1 when Blackthorn's dispatch had arrived with the word *dispatched* and the word had meant nothing and the nothing was the answer and the answer had not changed.

"The enemy."

"Scouts report orc forces consolidating in the outer ring. The Sundered Gate is held — they've moved through the tunnel. The Iron Marches are fully occupied. Movement along the northern approach suggests preparation for an advance into the Anvil." She consulted the slate. "Sergeant Dorran's observation posts report siege-engine activity on the ridge. The goblins are repositioning."

Repositioning. Skrixx Blazebinder's machines — the catapults, the fire-throwers, the crude but devastating instruments of goblin engineering — being moved to new positions that could reach the middle ring. The Anvil District was lower than the outer ring, the geography of the three-ring city descending toward the Emberheart like a bowl, and the descending meant the siege engines on the ridge now had clear lines of fire over the fallen outer wall and into the district where Stoneveil's barricades waited.

He looked at the gap in the roof. The grey light. The sky above the Anvil District — amber, wrong, the smoke of five days' fighting layered over the permanent forge-haze of a district whose forges had been cold for six months but whose air still carried the memory of what had burned.

"Walk with me, Captain."

---

The Anvil District was a graveyard.

Not metaphor — not the figurative graveyard of a place that had seen death and carried the memory. The district was a graveyard in the specific, physical sense that bodies were buried in it. Not deliberately buried — not the graves that the cleanup crews had dug after the firebombing, the shallow trenches along the district's southern edge where the remains had been interred with the efficiency of a municipality processing its dead. Those graves were marked, catalogued, entered into the registry that the Council maintained because the Council maintained registries for everything, even the things that the registries could not contain.

The bodies Stoneveil walked over now were different. These were the ones the cleanup crews had not found — the remains that the collapsed buildings had absorbed, the fragments that the rubble held the way the anvil held the cold, permanently, without the option of letting go. Six months of settlement had pressed them deeper. The rain had dissolved what the fire had left. The rats had done what the rats always did, and what the rats left was integrated into the stone and the ash and the charred timber in a way that made the walking a form of desecration he could not avoid because the walking was the job and the job required him to walk on the dead.

His dead.

Veyne walked beside him. She did not mention the bones. The bones did not require mentioning — they were visible in the rubble the way all things were visible in rubble, half-concealed, partial, fragments that could have been stone or timber or the remains of people who had been alive six months ago and were now part of the infrastructure that the Warden of the Sundered Gate was using to build his barricades.

The northern barricade was the first position.

Stoneveil stopped at the base and looked up. The barricade ran across the full width of the main avenue — forty feet, wall to wall, built from the collapsed masonry of the buildings on either side. The soldiers had constructed it with the grim, efficient creativity of men who had nothing except rubble and needed a wall and understood that the difference between rubble and a wall was the act of stacking. The stones were fitted. Not well — not with the precision of the dwarven masons who had built the Sundered Gate, not with the craft that had made Emberfall's walls the strongest in the Crimsonmarch. But fitted. Chest-high. Solid enough to stop a charge.

The stones were black.

Not the natural black of the dwarven basalt that the gate was built from. This black was different — the scorched, chemical-stained black of masonry that had been exposed to alchemist's pitch and sustained flame. The colour of the firebombing. The colour of the order he had given six months ago, baked into the stone the way the sound of the forge bell was baked into his memory, permanent, unremovable, a stain that went deeper than the surface because the surface was just where the stain began.

He put his hand on the barricade. The stone was cold. Everything in the Anvil was cold — the forges dead, the hearths dark, the particular, persistent absence of warmth that a district built around fire produced when the fire was removed. The cold was not the cold of morning or the cold of stone. It was the cold of a thing that had been hot and was now the opposite of hot, the temperature of aftermath, the thermal signature of a place that had burned everything it had and was left with nothing to burn.

"The stone is sound," Veyne said. "Dorran's engineers tested the load-bearing pieces. The firebombing weakened the mortar but the blocks themselves are intact. Dwarven stone."

Dwarven stone. The same stone the forge-shops had been built from — the heavy, dense basalt that the dwarven craftsmen had quarried from the deep mines and fitted into the buildings that the dwarven families had occupied before the humans came and the humans expanded and the dwarves were pushed to the margins and the margins were Stonehaven and the mining towns and the places where the world still valued what the dwarves could pull from the ground.

The stone survived the firebombing because the dwarves built things to survive. The dwarves built things to last. The irony was the kind of irony that Stoneveil did not permit himself to examine — that the craftsmanship of the people his empire had displaced had produced the rubble that was now the only thing between his garrison and the horde, and the rubble was better material than anything human hands could have provided.

"It will hold," he said.

Not a question. An assessment. The barricade would hold — not because the construction was sound, not because the engineering was adequate, but because the alternative to holding was the end, and the barricade did not get a vote.

He walked the line.

---

Forge Road.

The street that ran from the northern wall to the district's heart, the central artery of the Anvil, the road the forge carts had used to carry raw ore from the receiving yards to the smithies and finished blades from the smithies to the quartermaster's depot. Stoneveil had known this road for twenty years. He had walked it before the firebombing — walked it in the years when the Anvil District was a district, not a ruin, when the forges burned and the hammers rang and the air tasted of hot metal and the particular, acrid sweetness of the flux the smiths used to purify their steel.

Now the road was a corridor of ghosts.

The buildings on either side were shells. Roofless. The walls standing because the walls were dwarven stone, three feet thick, built for the heat of the forges they contained and therefore resistant to the heat of the incendiaries that had consumed everything the walls enclosed. The interiors were hollow — the floors collapsed, the machinery melted or warped beyond function, the forge hearths cracked and cold. Each building was a room with no ceiling and no contents, a box of stone containing ash and the memory of the thing the ash had been.

Soldiers moved through them. Stoneveil's soldiers — the sections redeployed from the retreat, the survivors of four days of wall fighting now converting forge-shops into fighting positions. They were cutting arrow slits into the masonry with the crude tools the Anvil's ruins provided — chisels salvaged from the smithies, hammers that had survived the fire, the implements of a trade that had built weapons for the Emberfall Legion and was now, in its death, providing the materials for the Legion's last defense.

Stoneveil stopped at a building he recognised.

Not by its structure — the structures were uniform, the dwarven architecture repeating its functional, utilitarian design along both sides of Forge Road. He recognised it by its position. Fourth from the northern wall. The building with the double chimney stacks — both collapsed now, the brick fallen inward, but the bases still visible, the twin columns of masonry rising three feet above the wall before ending in the ragged, heat-shattered termini of things that used to be taller.

The double-chimney building. The armourer's shop.

He had read the reports. After the firebombing — after the fires died and the cleanup crews went in and the registry was updated and the numbers were counted and the number was nine hundred and twelve and the subset was forty-three — the reports had crossed his desk in the clean, administrative format that the Council required. Building-by-building damage assessment. Contents inventory. Casualty allocation by structure.

This building — the armourer's shop, fourth from the northern wall, double chimney — had contained eleven people when the incendiaries fell. The armourer. His wife. His apprentices — three boys, aged fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen. The armourer's elderly mother, who had lived in the rooms above the shop because the rooms above the shop were all the family could afford and the family had been armouring Crimsonmarch soldiers for three generations and the three generations of service had earned them two rooms above a forge and a pension that would not survive the man who earned it.

And the others. Neighbours. A woman from the building next door who had come to shelter when the alarm sounded. Her daughter. A man whose name the registry had not recorded because the remains had not been sufficient for identification and the identification had been assigned the designation *unknown, male, estimated age 30-45, recovered from eastern stairwell debris*.

Eleven people. In this building. That Stoneveil was now using as a fighting position.

He walked inside.

The interior was ash and stone. The forge hearth — smaller than Blackhand's, a working forge for a working armourer — was cracked, the iron grate warped, the bellows mechanism melted into a lump of leather and metal that sat beside the hearth like a diseased organ. The anvil was smaller too — a single-horn piece, human-made, not dwarven, the steel face pitted and discoloured but intact. The armourer's anvil. The anvil where the blades had been made that the soldiers on the wall had carried.

A sergeant was inside. Directing two Legionnaires who were bracing a heavy timber across the doorframe — not as a door but as a support, the building's structure weakened by the fire and requiring reinforcement before it could serve as a position from which men would fight.

"Warden." The sergeant straightened. Not Dorran — a younger man, one of the section leaders from the eastern wall, a face Stoneveil knew without knowing, the features filed in the category of *competent, functional, sufficient*.

"This building."

"Position Three, sir. Arrow slits on the northern and eastern faces. Interior cleared. We can hold a squad of eight here — crossfire with Position Two across the road."

"The upper floors?"

"Gone. The fire took everything above the ground level. The staircase is rubble. But the walls are sound — Dorran's engineers confirmed. The stone—" The sergeant stopped. He had been going to say something about the stone, something technical, something about load-bearing capacity or structural integrity. He stopped because his boot had struck something in the ash.

The sergeant looked down. His foot had displaced a section of the ash layer — the compacted grey-white residue that covered the ground floor to a depth of two inches, the settled remains of everything the building had contained that was not stone. Beneath the ash, against the base of the wall, a shape.

Small. Curved. The colour of old ivory.

The sergeant looked at the shape. Looked at Stoneveil. His face — the face that had been delivering a position report — performed the adjustment that faces performed when the context of a room changed, when the floor beneath the boots became something other than a floor, when the ash became something other than ash.

Stoneveil looked at the shape.

He knew what it was. He knew what it was the way he knew the forty-three — not through examination, not through the clinical assessment that the reports had provided, but through the knowledge that lived in the locked room, the knowledge that the locked room existed to contain, the knowledge that the night had loosened and the morning had not tightened and the standing in this building, in this district, on this ash, had opened.

"Finish the position," Stoneveil said. "Reinforce the eastern wall. I want the squad in place by midday."

His voice was level. The mechanism was functioning. The voice was always functioning. The voice was the instrument that discipline had built from the same materials as the barricades — rubble, stacked, fitted, sufficient.

The sergeant looked at the shape in the ash. Looked at Stoneveil. Looked at the shape.

"Should we — sir, should we clear—"

"Finish the position, Sergeant."

The sergeant did not look at the shape again. He turned to the Legionnaires. The timber went up. The bracing was secured. The work continued, the way the work always continued, the way the machine continued, the way the siege continued — over what lay beneath, around what could not be moved, through the spaces that the dead had left and the living now occupied because the living needed the space and the dead no longer required it.

Stoneveil walked out.

Veyne was at the door. She had not entered. She had not needed to enter — the doorframe held the view, and the view was the sergeant's face and the shape in the ash and the Warden walking out with his voice level and his face level and his left hand pressed against his thigh where the tremor could not be seen.

She said nothing.

Stoneveil said nothing.

They walked on.

---

The barricade at the eastern approach used a section of wall from the old chandler's shop — the building at the corner of Forge Road and Anvil Lane, the shop that had sold the tallow candles the forge workers used when the gas-lamps failed and the forge-light was insufficient for the close work. The chandler had not been among the dead. The chandler had been among the two hundred who had escaped through the sewers before the perimeter sealed. Stoneveil knew this because the intelligence reports had tracked the survivors — tracked them the way intelligence tracked all populations, as numbers, as data points, as entries in a system that assigned each person a category and each category a priority and each priority an action.

The chandler's action had been *none*. Survivor. Civilian. Relocated to the Ashen Market District in the outer ring, which was now occupied by the Ironclaw and was therefore no longer the chandler's address or anyone's address but was instead a position on a map that the enemy held and the defenders had lost.

Stoneveil did not think about the chandler. He thought about the wall.

The wall — the section of the chandler's shop that the engineers had incorporated into the barricade — was solid. Two and a half feet of stone, the lower courses dwarven basalt, the upper courses human brick, the join visible as a line where the craftsmanship changed from the work that lasted to the work that sufficed. The engineers had braced it with timbers from the collapsed upper floors and buttressed it with rubble from the adjacent building, creating a position that was not a wall in the architectural sense but was a wall in the functional sense — the sense that mattered, the sense that stopped a charge and absorbed a hit and gave the men behind it something to stand behind that was harder than they were.

"Position Five. Complete. Squad assigned."

Stoneveil nodded. Walked on.

---

He completed the circuit in two hours.

Fourteen positions. Three primary barricades across the main approaches. Eight fighting positions in the converted forge-shops. Two observation posts on the Anvil District's remaining intact buildings — the warehouses at the southern edge, whose height provided sight lines to the outer ring and the ridge beyond. One command post.

The Black Anvil.

He returned to the forge at the ninth bell. The grey light had warmed — not to the amber of the siege-sky but to the sickly, diffuse yellow of sun filtered through smoke and the particular, persistent haze that the Anvil District produced, the haze of a place that had burned and stopped burning but had not stopped being a place that had burned.

He stood in the forge-hall.

The anvil was where he had left it. The anvil was where it had always been — in the centre, where Blackhand had placed it forty years ago, where the Forge-King had stood every day of his working life, where the hammer had risen and fallen and the steel had been shaped and the shaping had been the work and the work had been the man. The anvil had not moved when the fire came. The anvil had not moved when the ceiling collapsed. The anvil had not moved when the cleanup crews cleared the rubble around it and catalogued it as *salvageable, structural, to be assessed for reuse*.

It had not moved when Stoneveil placed his hands on it yesterday. It had not moved when the tremor transferred from his fingers into the metal. It had not moved when his body overrode his mind and he sat against the wall and slept for ninety minutes in the forge where the Forge-King had died.

He stood beside the anvil and looked at the forge-hall.

They had cleared it. Veyne's efficiency — the rubble pushed to the walls, the collapsed timber stacked, the floor swept to something approaching functionality. A table had been improvised from a section of the forge's heavy workbench — the thick oak surface, fire-darkened but intact, balanced on two stacks of cut stone. Veyne's slate was on the table. Maps — the district map, drawn by hand from memory and the intelligence reports, showing the fourteen positions, the barricade lines, the approaches. Supply counts. Casualty lists. The administrative machinery of a command post performing its function in the shell of a dead forge.

The command post was well-positioned. He had said this yesterday. The assessment was correct — central location, thick walls, the gap in the roof providing observation of the northern approach. Good ground. The kind of position a commander chose because it gave him control and visibility and the defensive depth that the situation required.

He had chosen it because it was good ground.

The forty-three had nothing to do with it.

The armourer's shop — the eleven — had nothing to do with it.

The shape in the ash had nothing to do with it.

These were facts. These were the facts that the operational ledger recorded and the locked room did not challenge, because the locked room was locked and the door was closed and the morning had not opened it. The morning had not opened it because the morning had brought the numbers and the positions and the circuit and the fourteen fighting positions that needed assessment and the four hundred and ninety-one who needed command and the siege that needed management and the management was the function and the function was the thing that kept the door closed.

He had chosen the Black Anvil because it was good ground.

He stood in the forge-hall and did not look at the anvil and did not think about the hammer and did not hear the forge bell that had rung its arrhythmic stutter as the tower collapsed and did not smell the thing he would not name, the sweetness beneath the ash, the scent that six months of rain and rot had not removed from the stone because the stone had absorbed it the way stone absorbed everything.

He did not think about these things.

The mechanism was functioning.

---

The first bombardment arrived at the tenth bell.

The sound was different from the outer ring — the catapult rounds arriving at a steeper angle, the trajectory adjusted for the shorter range and the lower elevation of the middle ring. The first impact hit the northern barricade — Position One, the primary obstacle across the main avenue. The stone absorbed it. Absorbed — not deflected, not shattered, the round hitting the barricade's face and the face holding because the stone was dwarven and the dwarven stone had been designed for forces greater than a catapult's payload, and the payload broke against the stone the way all things broke against dwarven work.

The second round hit the roof of Position Three.

The armourer's shop.

The impact brought down what remained of the eastern chimney stack — the base, the three feet of brick that had survived the firebombing and now collapsed inward under the catapult round's impact, the brick cascading into the interior where the sergeant's squad was positioned, where the arrow slits had been cut and the timber bracing had been secured and the ash on the floor contained the shape that the sergeant had found with his boot and that Stoneveil had seen and not acknowledged and ordered the sergeant to ignore.

"Casualty report from Position Three." A runner. Young. Not the boy from the outer ring — a different runner, the runners were all different now, the siege consuming them and producing new ones the way the siege consumed and produced everything, in a cycle that did not distinguish between the men it spent and the men it replaced.

"Three wounded. One dead. The chimney collapse caught them at the eastern wall. The dead man—" The runner stopped. Swallowed. "The dead man was Legionnaire Parson. He was at the arrow slit when the chimney came down."

Parson. A name. A name that went into Veyne's slate and the casualty column and the number that was now four hundred and ninety instead of four hundred and ninety-one, and the one that was subtracted was a man named Parson who had survived the outer ring and the retreat and the night in the Anvil and died because a chimney that had been standing for sixty years and had survived the firebombing chose this morning and this catapult round to complete its collapse.

"Reinforce Position Three. Get the wounded to triage. And tell the sergeant to shore up that eastern wall — I want timber bracing along the full interior face. If the chimney debris shifted the foundation courses, I need to know."

The runner went.

Stoneveil stood in the forge-hall. The bombardment continued — the rounds arriving at five-minute intervals, the same rhythm the catapults had maintained since Day 1, the patient, grinding tempo of an enemy that understood that persistence was more valuable than intensity and that the persistent application of force would do to the Anvil what it had done to the outer ring: not destroy it, but degrade it, wearing the defenses the way water wore stone, not with violence but with time.

He looked at the map. The fourteen positions. The three barricades. The approaches — north, east, west sealed. The geography of a district he had destroyed being used as the geography of a defense he was building, the ruins providing the material, the ruins providing the positions, the ruins providing the walls that stood because the hands that built them had built them to last and the man who had burned them was now the man who needed them to stand.

The symmetry was not subtle. The symmetry was the kind of thing that poets wrote about and commanders did not, because commanders did not have the luxury of symmetry. Commanders had positions and numbers and supply counts and the particular, grinding arithmetic of attrition that did not care about the poetry of the situation and did not care about the forty-three and did not care about the shape in the ash and did not care that the man standing in the forge-hall was the man who had made the forge-hall a ruin and the ruin a command post and the command post the centre of a defense that used the dead as foundation.

Stoneveil did not think about the symmetry.

He thought about the wall.

---

The assault came at midday.

Not the full commitment — not yet. The orc Warlord was probing, the same pattern he had used against the outer ring, the same patient, intelligent pressure that said the enemy commander understood that the middle ring's defenses were thinner than the outer ring's had been and that the thinness was an invitation that required careful testing before the full force was committed.

They came down the main avenue. Two hundred warriors — heavy infantry, the tooth-and-bone insignia, the warbands that had breached the outer ring's flanks and now pushed into the Anvil with the momentum of men who had tasted the first ring and were hungry for the second.

The northern barricade met them.

Stoneveil watched from the forge-hall's gap in the roof — the observation point that the collapse had created, the opening through which he had watched the Forge-King die and through which he now watched the Forge-King's district defend the city the Forge-King had rebelled against.

The symmetry. He did not think about the symmetry.

The barricade held. The dwarven stone, the fitted rubble, the chest-high wall that had been built by exhausted men from the wreckage of the man's atrocity — it held. The orcs hit it at a run and the wall did not give. The crossfire from Positions Two and Three caught them in the avenue — arrows from the arrow slits the soldiers had cut into the forge-shop walls, the converted smithies doing the work they had been converted to do, the death arriving from the buildings where the forge workers had slept and the armourer had worked and the eleven had died.

The cost was seven defenders. Three dead, four wounded. The orc force withdrew — pulled back through the avenue, shields up, the controlled retreat of a force that had tested the price and found it acceptable only in the sense that the testing was complete and the price was known and the next assault would adjust for it.

Seven. The number went into the ledger. Four hundred and eighty-three.

Veyne wrote.

Stoneveil stood at the gap in the roof and watched the avenue clear. The orc dead lay against the barricade — five, six, he counted seven, the dark shapes pressed against the black stone in poses that said everything about how they had died and nothing about who they had been. They had been warriors. They had been men — or the orc equivalent of men, the fighters who answered the Warlord's horn and walked toward the wall because the Warlord told them to walk toward the wall and the walking was what warriors did.

They died against a wall built from the bones of a district that another order had killed.

Stoneveil descended from the observation point. His boots on the forge-hall's stone floor. His steps measured. His hands — right steady, left trembling — at his sides. He walked to the table. To the map. To the numbers.

"Adjust Position Two's arc of fire. The crossfire corridor is too narrow — the orcs will learn to use the building fronts as cover. Widen the arrow slits by six inches. And I want oil caches at each barricade position — we're out of alchemy, but rendered fat will burn. Strip the kitchens."

Veyne wrote. The stylus moved. The ledger updated.

---

The afternoon was quiet.

Not the quiet of peace — the quiet of preparation. The orc Warlord was assessing. The probing assault had given him what he needed — the shape of the defenses, the location of the barricades, the positions of the crossfire points. He would adjust. He would commit more warriors. He would use the siege engines to soften the positions before the next push. The quiet was the pause before the mathematics changed, the breath between the count and the commitment.

Stoneveil used the quiet.

He walked the positions again. Checked the barricade repairs. Spoke to section commanders — short, precise conversations that were not conversations but exchanges of information, data transferred between the command post and the positions with the efficiency of a system that did not waste words because words were time and time was the thing the quiet was consuming.

He stopped at Position Seven.

Position Seven was different from the others. The others were forge-shops, smithies, the functional buildings of a working district. Position Seven was a home.

It had been a home. The structure was smaller than the forge-shops — a narrow, two-storey building wedged between the chandler's shop and a coal-store. Residential. Not the cramped apartments above the forge-shops where the workers slept in shifts. This was a house. A family's house. The kind of building that said someone had lived here who was not a forge worker and not a smith but a person who had chosen the Anvil District because the rents were cheap and the forges provided warmth in winter and the neighbourhood, before the rebellion and the firebombing and the dying, had been a neighbourhood.

The front wall was standing. The interior was gutted — the floors collapsed, the furniture ash, the domestic architecture of a life rendered into the same grey-white residue that covered every surface in the district. But the front wall had a window. The window had no glass — the heat had blown it out — but the frame was intact, and the frame was at street level, and the frame provided a line of sight to the eastern approach.

A soldier was at the window. A Legionnaire — one of Dorran's, the western-section survivors, a man whose face Stoneveil did not know and whose name Stoneveil did not ask. The man had balanced a crossbow on the windowsill and was sighting down the eastern approach, the weapon's stock braced against the frame, the bolt loaded and ready.

Below the window, on the interior wall, something.

Stoneveil saw it because he saw everything. The training — thirty years of assessment, of scanning, of the disciplined sweep that catalogued threats and assets and features in the continuous, automatic process that the military had built into him the way the dwarves had built endurance into their stone. He saw it because it was there.

A mark. On the interior wall, below the window, at the height a child would reach. Not a mark — a drawing. Charcoal on plaster. The crude, circular strokes of a hand that was learning to hold a writing implement and had not yet learned to control it. A face, perhaps. Or a sun. The ambiguous, universal shape that children drew because the shape was the first thing the hand could make and the first thing the eye could recognise and the making and the recognising were the same act.

Below the drawing, a line of symbols. Not letters — the pre-literate marks that came before letters, the child's attempt at writing that was not writing but the intention of writing, the desire to make marks that meant something the way the adults' marks meant something.

Stoneveil looked at the drawing.

He did not look at it for long. He did not need to. The drawing was not a piece of intelligence. The drawing was not a tactical asset. The drawing was not relevant to the defense of the Anvil District or the disposition of forces or the arithmetic of four hundred and eighty-three against the horde that waited beyond the barricades.

The drawing was a child's mark on a wall in a house in a district that had burned.

"Position Seven is adequate," Stoneveil said. "Maintain the observation."

He walked out.

He walked out and his left hand was against his thigh and the tremor was there and Veyne was beside him and the silence between them was the silence that had been between them since the forge, since the ash, since the shape and the sergeant's face and the voice that was level and the mechanism that was functioning and the functioning was the job and the job was the wall and the wall was built on the dead and the dead did not object because the dead were dead and the living needed the wall.

He did not think about the drawing.

He did not think about the face that might have been a sun that might have been the first thing a child drew before the child stopped drawing because the child stopped being a child because the Warden of the Sundered Gate gave an order and the order was correct and the correctness was the worst thing about it.

He walked.

---

Dusk.

Stoneveil stood in the forge-hall. The gap in the roof framed the sky — amber, darkening, the siege-sky settling into the bruised brown of an evening that would not be dark because the fires in the outer ring were still burning and the burning provided a glow that turned the night into something that was not night but was not day but was the particular, exhausted twilight of a city consuming itself.

The day's count: three dead, eleven wounded. Four hundred and eighty from the starting five twelve. Thirty-two in twenty-four hours. The rate was lower than the outer ring — the barricades were closer, the positions were tighter, the geography of the middle ring compressing the battlefield in a way that favoured the defense. But the rate was still running. The rate was always running. The rate was the river behind his eyes that carried the numbers toward the end the numbers described.

He stood at the anvil.

Not beside it. At it. His hands on the cold iron. The right hand, steady. The left hand, trembling. Both on the surface where the Forge-King's hammer had fallen, where the work had been done, where the last strike had rung before the wall buckled and the silhouette disappeared and the screaming stopped and the Warden of the Sundered Gate had stood on the wall above and watched and not looked away because that was the rule.

You watch what you order.

He was watching now. Not the fire — the fire was six months gone, the fire was ash and cold stone and the settled remains of nine hundred and twelve people who had been alive when the third bell rang. He was watching the thing the fire had left. The district. The ruins. The barricades built from the rubble of the buildings he had burned. The positions in the forge-shops where the dead had lived. The drawing on the wall. The shape in the ash. The bones in the rubble that the barricades were stacked on. The dead in the foundation. The dead in the walls. The dead everywhere, under everything, the Anvil District not a district but a tomb that the living were defending because the tomb was all they had left and the living did not have the luxury of choosing ground that was not someone else's grave.

The locked door was open.

Not because Stoneveil had opened it. He had not opened it — the door had no handle on the inside, no mechanism that the man could operate. The door opened because the place operated it. The district. The forge. The anvil beneath his hands. The same anvil, the same spot, the same iron that had received the Forge-King's hammer and was now receiving the Warden's tremor, and the tremor was the truth, and the truth was the thing behind the door.

He had done this.

Not the siege. Not the orcs. Not the assault or the bombardment or the casualties that the day had added to the ledger. He had done *this* — the district, the ruins, the dead in the foundation. He had given the order. He had watched the incendiaries arc. He had heard the screaming and the screaming had stopped and he had turned to give his next order, and the next order had been the next order, and the order after that had been the order after that, and the orders had continued for six months and the orders had been correct and the correctness had brought him here, to this forge, to this anvil, to this spot where a dwarf had raised his hammer for the last time and finished his work because that was what smiths did, even when the fire was coming, even when the man who ordered the fire was watching.

He stood in Drelgar Blackhand's forge.

The forge-hall was quiet. The bombardment had stopped for the night — the same pattern, the siege engines pausing as darkness consolidated, the orc crews resting and reloading. The defenders were posted — the night watches at the barricades, the observation posts manned, the system running the way systems ran when the man who ran them stepped away from the mechanism and stood in the silence and heard what the mechanism's noise had been covering.

He heard it.

Not the screaming — the screaming was six months gone, absorbed by the stone and the ash and the memory that the locked room had held. What he heard was the silence that came after. The silence that had settled over the Anvil District when the last voice stopped and the forge bell stopped and the fires died to embers and the cleanup crews came in at dawn and began the work of counting what was left. The silence of nine hundred and twelve people no longer making sound. The silence of forty-three children no longer making the particular, small, unformed sounds that children made — the sounds that were not words but were the intention of words, the desire to speak, the marks on a wall that were not letters but were the desire to write.

The silence was in the stone. In the anvil. In the cold iron beneath his trembling hand.

He had done this.

And now he was defending it.

The thought arrived without permission. The thought was not a thought but a recognition — the kind of recognition that occurred not in the mind but in the body, in the place where the tremor lived, in the mechanism that discipline had not built and could not control. He was defending the Anvil District. He was defending the ruins of his own atrocity. He was standing on the ashes of nine hundred and twelve people and building walls from their bones and cutting arrow slits into the buildings where they had lived and positioning soldiers in the rooms where they had died and using their deaths as his foundation the way the barricades used the rubble as their foundation, and the foundation was the dead, and the dead were his, and the defense was built on them.

The forty-three were in the room. The room was the forge-hall. The room was the district. The room was the Anvil, the whole Anvil, and the door was open and the forty-three were not behind the door but under the floor and in the walls and in the ash and in the shape the sergeant had found and in the drawing the child had made and in the stone of the barricades and in the cold iron of the anvil and in every surface his hands had touched and every step his boots had taken and every order he had given since yesterday when he had walked through the gate tunnel and emerged into the district he had destroyed and stood in the forge of the man he had killed and placed his hands on the work that the man had died finishing.

His hands were on the anvil.

Both hands. The right, steady. The left, trembling. Both pressing into the iron. Both receiving the cold. Both in the place where the work had been done.

He stood there for a long time.

Then the runner came.

"Warden. The observation posts report movement on the northern approach. Large-scale. The orc Warlord is massing."

Stoneveil removed his hands from the anvil. He straightened. The mechanism engaged — the gears and the levers and the discipline that converted the man into the commander, the tremor into the function, the silence into the voice that gave orders.

"Wake the reserves. All sections to positions. Barricade crews stand to. Tell Dorran I want the crossfire corridor lit — torches along the avenue. If they're coming in the dark, we make them come in the light."

His voice was level.

His hands were at his sides. The right, steady. The left pressed against his thigh.

He walked to the table. To the map. To the numbers.

Four hundred and eighty.

The number sat behind his ribs, beside the forty-three, beside the thirteen, beside the seven hundred and seventy and the five hundred and twelve and every number the siege had produced and every number the Anvil had produced and every number the man had carried since Ashgate, since the Crimson Docks, since the third bell rang and the incendiaries arced and the screaming began and the screaming stopped and the silence settled and the silence was the thing he heard when he stood in the forge and placed his hands on the anvil and the anvil gave him nothing back.

Nothing but the cold.

Nothing but the weight.

Nothing but the truth that the tremor carried and the discipline refused and the mechanism covered and the night revealed: that the Warden of the Sundered Gate was defending a graveyard, and the graveyard was his work, and the walls were bones, and the bones were the cost, and the cost was correct, and the correctness was the thing that would kill him — not the orcs, not the siege, not the blade or the bolt or the bombardment, but the slow, grinding knowledge that every correct decision he had ever made was a stone in a wall that was built on the dead, and the dead were his, and the wall was his, and the man who stood on the wall was the man who had put the dead beneath it.

And the wall held.

And the orders came.

And the mechanism continued.

And Warden Alric Stoneveil stood in the ghost district, in the ruin of his own making, and gave the orders that the night required, and the orders were correct, and the orders came easily.

They always did.
