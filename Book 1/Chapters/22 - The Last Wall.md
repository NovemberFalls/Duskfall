# Chapter 22 — THE LAST WALL

## Day 6 — Dawn

---

The count came in at the fourth bell.

Stoneveil stood at the warped anvil with his hands pressed flat against its surface and read the slate Veyne had placed before him. Her handwriting was smaller than it had been on Day 1 — the numbers had shrunk to fit the diminishing space between acceptable and impossible. The chalk was faint. She was running low on that, too.

**Effective strength: 347.**

He read the number twice. Not because he hadn't understood it. Because the number deserved the weight of being read twice before he filed it and kept moving.

Three hundred and forty-seven.

The night assault had hit at the second bell — three hours before dawn, when the torches along the crossfire corridor had guttered to embers and the men on the northern barricade were operating on the kind of wakefulness that was indistinguishable from sleep. The orcs had come down the main avenue in force. Not a probe. Not a test. A committed push with heavy infantry and a warband Stoneveil hadn't seen before — larger orcs, broader across the chest, carrying tower shields that caught the crossbow bolts like kindling in a fence.

The secondary barricade held.

It held because Sergeant Dorran's engineers had built it correctly, because the crossfire positions had functioned as designed, and because the men behind the stone and timber had fought in the dark with the ugly, mechanical efficiency of soldiers who had stopped hoping and started simply executing. The barricade held.

The cost was one hundred and thirty-three men and women since dusk.

Stoneveil pressed his left hand against the anvil's surface. The tremor was worse in the mornings. He had learned to anticipate it the way he anticipated supply shortages — as a condition to be managed, not a problem to be solved. His right hand was steady. The callus between thumb and forefinger had crusted over with something that was not quite scab and not quite skin. It would hold.

Veyne stood at the forge entrance, her slate under one arm, waiting. She had not sat down in his presence since Day 3. He suspected she had not sat down at all.

"Breakdown," he said.

"Two hundred and nine combat-effective on the line. Forty-one in reserve rotation — walking wounded who can hold a position but not manoeuvre. Sixty-two at the secondary barricade and flanking positions. Twenty-three in the observation posts and runner network. Twelve war-mages, but Aldermyre says three of them are channelling on residual — they'll have one engagement left, maybe two, before burnout."

"Medical?"

"Fifty-one wounded in the triage stations. Fourteen of those will die today regardless of treatment. The rest—" She paused. Not for drama. Because the pause was the answer. "The rest are being treated with what we have, which is boiled cloth and willpower."

Stoneveil looked at the number on the slate again. Three hundred and forty-seven, and that counted the walking wounded and the war-mages running on fumes and the men in the observation posts who could hear the orcs massing but couldn't see them through the smoke that hadn't cleared since Day 4.

Eight hundred and fifty. That was what he'd started with. Captain Veyne's count on Day 1, delivered with the same flat precision she delivered everything — as though the number were a fact and facts did not require emotion. Eight fifty combat-ready.

Five hundred and three gone. More than half.

He pushed away from the anvil.

"The Emberheart," he said.

Veyne's expression did not change. It had not changed since the outer ring fell. The muscles of her face had found a configuration that communicated competence without the expense of expression, and they had stayed there.

"Runner returned twenty minutes ago. Lord Commander Blackthorn acknowledges the situation. The Ironbound Guard remains committed to the defence of the Inner Ring. No reserves will be released to the Anvil District."

"His words?"

"'The Emberheart must hold. All other positions are expendable.'"

Stoneveil heard the sentence. He filed it in the place where he filed everything that was true and useless. The Emberheart must hold. The Anvil District was expendable. Three hundred and forty-seven people were expendable. The children in the dormitories behind the southern barricade were expendable. The wounded in the triage stations were expendable.

Blackthorn was correct. That was the architecture of defence — concentric rings, each one sacrificed to buy time for the next. Stoneveil had designed this doctrine himself, at Ashgate, where the same mathematics had saved four hundred and twenty lives by spending six hundred and eighty. The numbers worked. They always worked.

The numbers were the worst part.

"Write the final report," he said.

Veyne pulled the slate from under her arm. She did not ask what to write. She had been composing it since the fourth bell, the way she composed everything — in advance, in silence, waiting for the order that made the composition real.

"Warden Alric Stoneveil, Anvil District, Day Six. Effective strength three four seven. Outer ring lost. Anvil District defensive positions holding at sixty percent integrity. Ammunition critical — bolts at eighteen percent, arrows at twenty-two. No alchemical reserves. Food for approximately one more day of combat operations. Water stable." He paused. Not because he was composing. Because the next sentence was the one that mattered and he wanted to say it aloud before it became chalk on slate. "The Anvil District will hold until it falls. There will be no withdrawal. Request acknowledged. No further reports will be sent."

Veyne wrote. Her chalk did not hesitate.

"Send it."

She turned and was gone. The forge was silent except for the low murmur of runners passing outside and the distant, rhythmic sound of something heavy being dragged across stone — the engineers reinforcing a barricade position, or the orcs moving siege equipment, or the city itself settling under the weight of what had been done to it. Stoneveil could no longer distinguish between the sounds of defence and destruction. They had become the same thing.

---

He walked the line at dawn.

The sky was the colour of old iron — not grey, not dawn-gold, but the sick, mineral orange that the smoke gave everything when the sun tried to push through and failed. Five days of siege fires, collapsed buildings, alchemist's pitch, and goblin engine residue had built a canopy over the Anvil District that turned daylight into something that wasn't quite darkness but wasn't light either. It was the colour of a bruise. It had been the colour of a bruise for two days.

The northern barricade had taken the worst of the night assault. The dwarven basalt blocks had held — they always held, those blocks, three feet of dense stone that had survived the firebombing and would likely survive whatever came next — but the timber bracing between them was splintered and the stones on the eastern edge had been shifted by the weight of bodies pressed against them. Orc dead lay in the crossfire corridor where the torchlight had caught them. Eight of them, piled where the angles of fire converged. His soldiers had dragged two of their own dead from behind the barricade sometime before dawn.

Corporal Tesswin held the barricade now. She was young — twenty-four, maybe twenty-five — and she had the voice of a woman twice her age. She'd been a gate guard three days ago. Now she commanded eleven soldiers and a section of wall that constituted the northern edge of everything that remained of Emberfall's defence.

"Corporal."

"Warden." She did not salute. Saluting required lifting an arm, and the effort wasn't worth the tradition. "They pulled back an hour before dawn. Massing again north of the chandler's ruin. I can hear them but not see them."

"Numbers?"

"More than last night."

Stoneveil looked north through the gap between the barricade's upper stones. The chandler's ruin was forty paces away — a gutted shell where he could see movement in the smoke, the dark shapes of armoured bodies shifting behind what remained of the walls. The orcs had learned the crossfire corridor. They would not walk into it again. Next time, they would come from the sides, through the buildings, the way they had tried at the secondary barricade on Day 5.

"When they come, they'll breach through the forge-shops on either flank. Positions Two and Four. The avenue assault will be a fixing action."

"I know," Tesswin said.

He looked at her. She looked back. There was nothing in her eyes that required his inspection — she understood the situation, she understood the geometry, and she understood that the eleven soldiers behind her were all she had to hold a position designed for thirty.

"Hold as long as you can. When you can't, fall back to the secondary."

"Yes, Warden."

He moved on.

---

Position Three — the armourer's shop with the double chimney, one chimney now collapsed — held a crossbow team of four. The easternmost chimney stack had been rebuilt with loose rubble and timber to create an elevated firing position. It would collapse if hit by a catapult round, killing whoever was in it. The soldiers knew this. They manned it anyway because the elevation gave them a sight line that covered the junction of Forge Road and the main avenue, and sight lines were worth dying for.

Position Seven — the residential ruin with the child's charcoal drawing still visible on the interior wall. Six soldiers, two of them walking wounded. The crossbow aperture had been widened since yesterday; a section of wall had crumbled under bombardment and the soldiers had propped a timber beam across the gap and called it a firing port. It functioned. Everything in the Anvil functioned through the marriage of ruin and necessity.

Stoneveil did not look at the drawing.

He had looked at it once, on the first day in the Anvil. That was enough.

The southern barricade — the last line before the civilian shelters and the command post — was Sergeant Dorran's work. Dorran had built it the way Dorran built everything: correctly, without flourish, every stone fitted to the stone beside it with the precision of a man who understood that precision was the difference between a wall and a pile of rubble. Dorran stood beside it now, checking the timber bracing with his hands, testing each joint the way a physician tested a pulse.

"Sergeant."

"Warden." Dorran's hands were black — not with soot, though there was soot, but with the accumulated grime of five days of engineering work done without gloves, without rest, and without the luxury of cleaning anything that still functioned. "The foundation's solid. Eastern edge took some settlement overnight from the bombardment, but the base course is dwarven. It'll hold."

"The charges."

Dorran's hands stopped moving.

"We found the tunnel entrance this morning. Access point through the old sewer junction, two blocks north. They've been under us." He looked at Stoneveil with the expression of a man delivering a report that he wished were inaccurate. "I sent two men down. They found packed charges against the barricade's foundation. Three positions. Goblin compound — the same mix their engines use. If those detonate simultaneously, this barricade comes apart. The buildings on either side come down with it. Fifty feet of street, gone."

Stoneveil looked at the barricade. At the stones Dorran had fitted with such care. At the crossfire positions that had killed fourteen orcs in two minutes yesterday.

"Can we disarm them?"

"Not without a sapper who understands goblin fusing. Their detonation system uses chemical timing — sequential burns through compound-soaked cord. Cut the wrong line, you detonate early. Leave them, you detonate on their schedule."

"Flood the tunnels."

"We'd need to breach the cistern feeds. That's our water supply. And the tunnel network runs under most of the district — flooding it might undermine the building foundations we're using as fighting positions."

There was no good answer. Stoneveil had known this before he asked the questions. He asked them anyway because command required the performance of deliberation even when the deliberation was already complete.

"Post a listening team in the tunnel access. Two men. If they hear movement — fuse-cutting, footsteps, anything — I want to know immediately. We won't disarm. We'll react."

"React how?"

"If the barricade goes, we fall back to the southern line. The dormitory wall. The last position before the Emberheart gate."

Dorran looked at the dormitory wall — a thin line of stone buildings that had never been designed as a defensive position because no one had imagined the defence would be pushed this far back. Behind it were the civilians. Behind them was the gate to the Inner Ring, which Lord Commander Blackthorn had closed and reinforced and manned with the Ironbound Guard who would not be coming to help.

"That's not a wall, Warden. That's a suggestion."

"Then we hold this one."

---

He returned to the forge at the sixth bell.

The Black Anvil was quiet. The forge's great chimney, cracked and useless, let in a column of smoke-filtered light that fell across the warped anvil in a bar of grey-orange. Stoneveil had grown accustomed to standing in that light. It was the closest thing to visibility the Anvil District offered, and command required seeing clearly even when clarity was a cruelty.

He stood there now and looked at the reports. Not the numbers — he had already filed the numbers. The reports from the observation posts, delivered by runners whose ages he had stopped tracking because the runners kept getting younger and the tracking was a distraction.

The orcs were massing on three fronts. North — the main avenue, the chandler's ruin, the approach that the crossfire corridor was designed to bleed. East — Forge Road, where Position Three's elevated crossbow team would hold them for perhaps twenty minutes before the chimney position collapsed. And west — the sealed approach, Smelter's Row, where Dorran's engineers had collapsed the overhang to create a wall-to-wall rubble barrier.

The scouts reported movement at the western seal. The orcs were digging.

Three fronts. Three hundred and forty-seven defenders. The arithmetic was the kind that didn't require calculation.

He looked at the anvil — at the warped striking surface where Forge-King Drelgar Blackhand had worked iron into art before Stoneveil had worked alchemist's pitch into murder. The forty-three pressed at the locked door. He pressed back. Not yet. There would be time for the forty-three when the fighting stopped. There would be time for all of it — the fire, the screaming, the small bones in the ash — when the fighting stopped.

If the fighting stopped.

He turned from the anvil and walked out through the forge entrance into the dim, smoke-thick morning.

---

They gathered in the street.

Not all of them — that was impossible, and unnecessary, and tactically irresponsible. But the runners had passed the word, and the soldiers who could be spared from their positions had filtered in, and the walking wounded who were still on their feet had come because walking toward something was easier than sitting and waiting for it to come to you.

They stood in the street outside the Black Anvil — Forge Road, once the beating heart of the Anvil District's smithing trade, now a corridor of hollow buildings and scorched stone that smelled of old fire and new blood. Perhaps two hundred of them. The rest held their positions and would hear the words secondhand, delivered by runners who would strip the sentences down to their essentials because essentials were all anyone had the energy to process.

Stoneveil stood on the forge's threshold — one step above the street, enough elevation to be seen without the theatre of climbing onto something. He had never been a man for theatre. The soldiers who had served under him at Ashgate knew this. The soldiers who had survived five days in the Anvil knew this. The ones who were new to his command — conscripts, walking wounded pressed back into service, the composite unit remnants who had fought their way through the Iron Marches and the Anvil's ruins — would learn it now.

He looked at them.

They looked back.

He had seen this before. At Ashgate, on the third day, when the pass had narrowed to a killing corridor and the orcs had committed their reserves and the mathematics had turned from difficult to impossible. The soldiers' faces had looked the same — not afraid, not brave, but *present* in the way that people become present when the future contracts to the next several hours and everything beyond that becomes abstract.

Some of them sat against the walls. Some leaned on weapons they were too tired to lift and too stubborn to put down. A Legionnaire near the back — young, a bandage around his head that had soaked through and been rewrapped with what looked like a strip of someone's cloak — stood with his arms crossed and his chin up and his eyes tracking Stoneveil with the kind of attention that was either respect or the desperate focus of a man looking for someone to tell him what to do.

Captain Veyne stood to Stoneveil's left, her slate held at her side, her face carrying the same controlled absence it had carried since Day 1. She had not changed. The siege had not changed her. Stoneveil suspected this was because the siege had nothing left to take from her that she hadn't already given away.

Sergeant Dorran was at the back, near Position Five. He had not come to hear a speech. He had come because his engineers needed to see that the Warden was still standing and still giving orders, and Dorran understood that the presence of command was a structural element, like a load-bearing wall.

Stoneveil did not raise his voice. He had never needed to. His voice carried the way stone carried weight — not through force, but through density.

"The Emberheart will not release reserves. Lord Commander Blackthorn considers the Anvil District expendable. No reinforcements are coming. No relief column. No reserves. What you see around you is everything."

He paused. Not for effect. Because the silence after a sentence like that needed room to land.

"I won't tell you we'll win. I won't tell you help is on the way. I won't tell you that what we're doing here matters to anyone behind that gate." He looked toward the south, where the gate to the Inner Ring stood closed and barred and indifferent. "It matters to us. It matters to the wounded in the triage stations and the civilians in the dormitories and every person in this district who cannot hold a sword. That is enough."

A woman in the second row — one of the walking wounded, her left arm strapped to her chest, a crossbow balanced against her hip with her right hand — nodded once. Not agreement. Acknowledgment. The nod of a person who had already made the calculation and arrived at the same answer.

"We hold this ground. Not because we can win. Because this is where we are and there is no other place to go. The orcs will hit the northern barricade, the eastern approach, and the western seal. They will breach at least one. When they do, we fall back to the next position. And the next. And the one after that. Until there are no positions left, and then we hold the street, and when the street falls, we hold the rubble."

He looked at them — two hundred faces in the smoke, some of them soldiers, some of them something else, all of them the last thing standing between the Ironclaw horde and the gate to the Inner Ring.

"There is no speech for this. You don't need one. You know what's coming. You know what it costs. You've been paying it for five days."

He stepped down from the threshold. Not dramatically. The way a man steps down from a doorway when he has said what he came to say and has work to do.

"Man your positions."

They went.

No one cheered. No one saluted. No one said a word that wasn't functional. They turned and walked back to their posts — to the barricades and the crossbow apertures and the rubble walls and the ruins of the district that had already burned once and was about to burn again — with the heavy, deliberate gait of people who had heard the truth and found it lighter than the alternatives.

Stoneveil watched them go.

Veyne appeared at his shoulder. "The runner to Blackthorn is ready."

"Send it."

She hesitated. Veyne did not hesitate. The fact that she hesitated now was its own kind of report.

"The report says no further communication. If the runner goes—"

"Then we've said what needed saying and anything after is repetition." He looked at her. The woman who had not left the rampart, who had not slept more than ninety minutes at a stretch, who had kept the count when the count became an atrocity. "We hold, Captain. That's the order. That's the only order left."

She nodded. The same nod the wounded crossbow woman had given — not agreement, not courage, but the grim acknowledgment of a person who understood the mathematics and had chosen to stay anyway.

Stoneveil walked back into the forge. He placed his hands on the anvil — both of them, the trembling left and the steady right — and stood in the bar of grey-orange light that fell through the broken chimney. Outside, he could hear them moving. Soldiers walking to their positions. The scrape of weapons being checked. A cough from somewhere to the north. The low, steady rumble from beyond the barricade where the Ironclaw army gathered for the assault that would begin this day and end it, one way or another.

Three hundred and forty-seven.

He pressed his left hand flat against the iron until the tremor stopped.

It didn't stop.

He kept pressing anyway.
