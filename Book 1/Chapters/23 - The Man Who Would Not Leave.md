# Chapter 23 — THE MAN WHO WOULD NOT LEAVE

## Day 6 — The Final Assault

---

He found Edric at the secondary barricade.

The boy — the man — was crouched behind the rubble and timber with eight others, his shield braced against the basalt blocks, his sword drawn. The crimson sash that had been clean on Day 2 was black. The armour that had sat too large on a boy's frame had been battered into a shape that fit, the dents and the scrapes and the stripped rivets conforming to the body inside the way a cast conformed to a broken bone — not designed, but formed by the specific, intimate violence of what the body had endured.

November came from the north. He had been at Position Seven — the residential ruin with the child's drawing — when the first assault hit at dawn. The assault was different from the ones before. Not a probe. Not a test. The orcs came in force across all three fronts simultaneously, and the sound was different, the rhythm was different, the weight behind the attacks was different in the way that the last blow was different from all the blows before it — it had finality in it, the quality of something that intended to finish what it started.

Position Seven fell in twenty minutes.

November was not there when it fell. He was pulled back by the section commander — a Legionnaire whose name he'd never learned, a woman who communicated in the same compressed, gestural language that Rath had used before Rath died at the intersection on Day 4. She pointed south. November went south. Two soldiers went with him. The rest stayed at Position Seven, and the staying was measured in minutes and the minutes were measured in the sounds that came from behind as they moved through the smoke, the sounds that said the position was being overrun and the men who stayed were paying what positions cost when positions fell.

He moved through the Anvil's ruins. The streets he had fought through yesterday were changed — the barricade remnants smashed, the buildings further collapsed, the district contracting as the orc assault compressed the defenders into the shrinking space between the secondary barricade and the southern dormitories. The smoke was thicker. Blacker. Not the amber haze of the previous days but something darker, denser, the smoke of structures that were burning with purpose because someone — Skrixx, the goblin engineers, the siege machine that never stopped producing new ways to break things — had found something that burned hotter and longer and produced smoke that sat in the chest like tar.

He found Edric at the secondary barricade, and the finding was a thing he felt in his sternum — the compression releasing, the breath that came easier, the compass needle settling because the person it was tracking was alive and whole and here.

"November."

Edric said his name the way he had said it on Day 2 in the staging area — with the particular weight of a person who had decided that the name meant something and the meaning was not subject to revision. But the voice was different. Deeper. Not from age — from use. Five days of smoke and shouting and the sounds a throat made when the body behind it was running beyond its specifications had reduced Edric's voice to something that sounded like gravel in a drum, the same rasp that November heard when he spoke and that every man on the wall shared, the shared vocal register of people who had been screaming for a week.

"You made it south," November said.

"Yesterday. After the wall came down." Edric's eyes moved across November's face — the same assessment, the fast inventory that five days of siege had made automatic. Checking for new damage. Finding it. Filing it. "You went north."

"Yes."

"You went toward the fighting."

"There were civilians behind the dormitories. Under the rubble."

Edric looked at him. The brown eyes — the same brown, always the same — held the expression that November had seen growing since Day 3, since the sound of the anvil, since the word *miss* and the word *enough* and the two words that Edric had said after the retreat: *I know.* The expression was not surprise. It was the absence of surprise. The specific, settled certainty of a person who had learned what November was and had stopped being surprised by it.

"How many?"

"Five. Two children."

Edric nodded. Adjusted his shield. The blacksmith's hands — the broad palms, the hammer calluses — were darker now, the skin cracked and stained with the accumulated grime of five days of grip and blood and the specific, intimate dirt that metal left on the hands that held it.

"Good," he said.

Not the soldier's *good* — the flat, practical acknowledgment of a useful outcome. This was something else. Something that had the weight of the anvil's ring in it, the sound that sat in the chest and went into the bones. *Good.* The word of a man who had decided what mattered and had found it in five people pulled from rubble by a man with one working arm.

---

The secondary barricade was Dorran's work. November had heard about it — the dwarven basalt blocks, the timber bracing, the crossfire positions that funnelled the northern approach into a killing corridor. He had not stood behind it until now. The barricade was chest-high at its lowest point, head-high where Dorran's engineers had stacked the basalt in double courses, and it stretched across the avenue and into the buildings on either side, the rubble and the stone and the timber forming a wall that was not a wall in any architectural sense but was doing the work of one.

Behind the barricade: ten defenders. Edric. Two Legionnaires November didn't recognise — a man with his helmet gone and a bandage around his skull, and a woman whose shield arm was strapped to her body in a sling that looked like it had been made from a curtain. Three auxiliaries with spears. Two soldiers from composite units, fragments of fragments. And a boy — not a soldier, a runner, fifteen at most, who crouched at the western end of the barricade with a water skin and the particular, wide-eyed expression of a child who was in a place children were not supposed to be and who had not yet been given the order to leave.

November and the two soldiers from Position Seven made thirteen.

Thirteen, holding a barricade built for thirty.

The compass noted this. The compass did not comment. The compass dealt in the immediate — standing, sober, the Creed — and the immediate was that November was behind a barricade with Edric beside him and the fighting had not yet reached them and the not-yet was a space he could occupy until it ended.

He crouched beside Edric. His body protested — the catalogue of costs that had been accumulating since Day 1 presenting its updated ledger. The left arm, still strapped to his side with the cloth Edric had given him on Day 3, still useless, the joint a permanent fixture of pain that had become so constant it was no longer pain but a condition, a weather pattern, the way the smoke was a weather pattern. His right hand, wrapped around Darya's sword, the grip too tight, the blisters that had been blisters that had been calluses that had been blisters again reduced to raw flesh that wept against the leather. The thigh — the cut from yesterday's fighting, shallow but stiffened overnight, the scab cracking with each movement and leaking sluggishly into the fabric of his trousers. His ribs, still banded, still aching, the stone that had hit his back during the retreat on Day 4 having left a bruise that spread across his spine and wrapped around his sides and made breathing a negotiation between the lungs and the bones that held them.

He was operational. That was the word. Not functional — functional implied a standard he no longer met. Operational. The word the soldiers used for equipment that was damaged but had not yet stopped working.

"When?" November asked.

Edric didn't need the question finished. "They massed at the chandler's ruin an hour ago. Three warbands. The scouts said they're bringing a ram — timbers from the buildings they took yesterday, lashed together. The ram hits the barricade, the infantry comes over."

"The crossfire?"

"Position Three fell at dawn. The chimney came down." Edric said it the way he said everything now — flat, compressed, the information delivered without the emotional charge that would have accompanied it three days ago. Position Three was the armourer's shop with the double chimney, the elevated crossbow position that covered the junction. It had fallen. The four soldiers in the chimney position were under the rubble. The crossfire corridor that was designed to bleed the approach was now a corridor with one fewer angle of fire, and the one fewer was the one that covered the direct advance.

November looked north through a gap between the barricade's upper stones. The avenue stretched away into smoke. Forty paces to the first intersection. Sixty to the chandler's ruin. Beyond that, shapes — the dark, moving mass of the Ironclaw army assembling for the final push, the shapes indistinct in the haze but present, the presence a pressure that November felt in the same place he felt the compass, the same inner chamber that registered the direction of things that mattered.

"Edric."

"Yes."

November looked at him. At the face that had been a boy's face on Day 2 and was something else now — not older, not harder, but defined, the features settled into the specific configuration of a man who had decided what he was and the deciding had left its mark the way a hammer left its mark on iron. The jaw set. The eyes focused. The fear still there — November could see it, had always been able to see it — but compressed, shaped, forged into something that was not fear's opposite but fear's companion, the alloy that formed when terror and will were heated together and struck until they fused.

"I'm glad you're here," November said.

The words were inadequate. They were the wrong size for the thing they were trying to contain — the five days, the shared wall, the ankle and the shield, the anvil's ring, the retreat, the weight of a man called Brenn carried between them, the word *I know* that had been a door opening. The words were inadequate and he said them anyway because the Anvil District was about to burn for the third time and the compass said that the things that mattered should be said while there was a mouth to say them.

Edric looked at him. The expression was the one from the wall on Day 3, the one that had opened the door. The one that was young and old at the same time, the boy and the man coexisting in a face that the siege had been shaping the way a forge shaped iron — with heat, with force, with the patient, brutal insistence of a process that did not care about the metal's opinion.

"I said I'd be beside you," Edric said. "I'm beside you."

He said it the way he'd said *I know* — with the weight of a hammer falling. The simplest truth. The one that didn't need explanation because the explanation was five days long and lived in the space between them and the space was full.

November gripped Darya's sword. Too tight. The same mistake.

He did not adjust.

---

The ram hit at the eighth bell.

The sound was not an impact — it was a detonation, the massed weight of timber and iron striking the basalt blocks with a force that November felt in his spine and his teeth and the spaces between his ribs where the bruising made every vibration a separate, specific event. The barricade shuddered. The timber bracing behind the basalt groaned — the long, structural sound of wood being pushed past its tolerance, the kind of sound that buildings made before they fell, the kind of sound that walls made before they became rubble.

The barricade held.

The ram pulled back. November could hear the orcs behind it — the grunting, coordinated effort of warriors pulling the timber assemblage back for a second blow, the rhythm of labour that was also the rhythm of siege, the patience of an army that had come to break a wall and was breaking it one blow at a time.

The second impact hit the same point. The basalt shifted — not much, a fraction, an inch — but the shift was enough to tell November's bones what the defenders at the Sundered Gate must have felt when the original ram hit the original gate on Day 1. The dwarven stone was stronger than anything humans could build. But dwarven stone was not infinite, and the ram was not the only thing hitting it.

"Here they come," the Legionnaire with the bandaged skull said.

The orcs came over the top.

Not through — the barricade was too solid for that, Dorran's engineering holding against the battering, the basalt absorbing the force that would have shattered human masonry. But the orcs had brought other things. Ladders — crude, timber assemblages roped together, shorter than the scaling ladders from the wall but adequate for a barrier that was head-high. The ladders hit the barricade's face and the orcs climbed and the climbing was fast, the warriors swarming up in the heavy, muscular surge of bodies that had been told the thing on the other side was the last thing between them and victory.

The first orc crested the barricade three paces from November.

He was big. They were always big — the observation that had been useless on Day 2 and was still useless on Day 6, the fact that orc warriors were larger and stronger and faster than the man holding the borrowed sword, the fact that had not changed and would not change and was the permanent, structural context of every fight November had been in since the siege began.

The Legionnaire with the bandaged skull met the first orc. Shield against body, the trained response, the impact that stopped the climber's momentum at the top of the barricade and sent him backward, off balance, the shield doing what shields did — buying the second of time between the arrival and the response. The Legionnaire's sword followed the shield — a thrust, fast, the blade finding the orc's exposed side above the hip where the climbing had lifted the armour away from the body.

The orc fell back.

Another came. And another. The barricade's crest became a line of contact — orcs climbing, defenders striking, the particular, compressed violence of a position being assaulted by men who had to climb over a wall to reach the men who were killing them. The geometry favoured the defenders. The numbers did not.

November fought.

He fought the way he had fought since Day 2 — badly, desperately, with the artless, convulsive violence of a man whose body had never been taught the language of combat and was speaking it anyway, in a dialect that was all verbs and no grammar. He swung Darya's sword at the shapes that appeared above the barricade. The lighter blade was faster than the borrowed sword had been — faster, but his arms were slower, the muscles that had been carrying and fighting and lifting for six days producing strikes that were heavy and late, the timing a half-beat behind the moment the strike should have arrived.

He hit an orc's arm. The blade caught the bracer and skidded and drew a line across the forearm that was too shallow to matter and the orc barely noticed, the warrior dropping over the barricade's edge and into the space behind it with the momentum of a body in full assault, the impact driving November backward, his boots sliding on the cobblestones, the distance between his body and the orc's body shrinking to nothing.

Edric's shield. Between them. The crash of iron on iron, the sound that had been November's salvation since Day 2 — Edric's shield, Edric's body, the boy who had decided that the man who grabbed an ankle was worth protecting. The shield caught the orc's downward stroke and redirected it, the blade skating along the surface, and Edric's sword came around the shield's edge and found the gap below the orc's arm and the orc went down with the sound they always made, the wet, abbreviated noise of a body discovering its interruption.

"Stay behind me!" Edric shouted. The words were automatic — the trained response, the soldier's directive to the man without armour who was standing too far forward, who was always too far forward, who did not understand the geometry of defensive fighting because he had never been taught the geometry and the not-knowing was a gap that Edric's shield covered the way it had covered every gap since Day 2.

November did not stay behind him.

He moved left. Another orc — smaller, faster, climbing the barricade at the junction where the basalt met the building's wall, where the rubble was lower and the climbing was easier and the defenders were thinner. The woman with the strapped arm — the sling, the curtain — was trying to hold the junction with a spear she held in one hand, the butt braced against the wall behind her, the point aimed at the crest, the weapon doing half the work it was designed for because half was what one arm could do.

November reached her. Swung. The blade caught the climbing orc across the face — a glancing blow, the edge sliding off the cheekbone, drawing blood but not stopping the climb. The orc crested the barrier. November swung again. His right arm ached — the muscles producing the motion through memory and stubbornness because the fuel that had driven them on Day 2 had been spent by Day 4 and what remained was the residue, the fumes, the last reserves of a body that had been operational past the point where operational had meaning.

The orc caught the blade on his bracer. Twisted. The sword pulled from November's grip — not knocked free, pulled, the orc's hand closing on the flat and wrenching with a strength that November's blistered, bleeding fingers could not match. The sword clattered to the cobblestones behind the barricade.

The orc swung.

November went down.

The blow caught him on the left side — the gap, always the gap, the dropped guard that had been a vulnerability since the training post and had been confirmed by every fight since. The orc's weapon — a short, curved blade, single-edged — hit his ribs above the hip. Not the edge. The flat. The angle was wrong for cutting, but the force was enough — the impact compressing the bruised bones, the pain arriving not as a sensation but as a structural event, the ribs telling the lungs that the arrangement between them was being renegotiated, the breath leaving and the leaving was not voluntary.

He hit the cobblestones. The world went. Not dark — white, the colour of pain that exceeded the body's ability to process it, the sensory overload that the nerves produced when the information coming in was more than the system was designed to carry.

Then it came back. Grey. The smoke. The underside of the sky that had been wrong for six days. The sound of fighting above him — the barricade, the orcs cresting, the defenders holding or dying, the percussion of it pressing against his ears the way the blast had pressed on Day 1.

He lay on his back. The cobblestones were wet. Blood — his, someone else's, the accumulation of a barricade fight that produced blood the way a forge produced sparks, as a byproduct, as the inevitable output of the process.

*Get up.*

The compass. Not a thought — a directive, issued from the inner chamber, the place where the Creed lived and the promises were stored and the mechanism that kept November Falls pointed at the next thing was grinding through the damage and producing the same instruction it always produced.

*Get up.*

He rolled. The ribs screamed. His right hand found the cobblestones. He pushed. The world tilted — the same tilt, the blast tilt, the inner mechanism that was supposed to locate vertical failing and trying and failing again. His knees found the ground. Then one foot.

He looked for Darya's sword. It was three paces away, against the base of the barricade. He lunged for it — not standing, crawling, the degraded locomotion of a body that was past walking and past running and past every mode of movement that implied coordination. His hand found the grip. The leather was wet with blood. He held.

Too tight. The same mistake.

He stood.

---

They held the barricade for forty minutes.

Forty minutes that were forty hours or forty seconds or a lifetime compressed into the rhythm of assault and repulse, climb and counter, the orcs coming over and the defenders pushing them back and the pushing back costing a man each time — the woman with the strapped arm taking a blow that buckled her spear and drove her into the wall, unconscious; one of the auxiliaries pulled over the barricade by an orc and the falling man's scream on the other side lasting three seconds; the runner, the fifteen-year-old boy, taking an arrow through the shoulder and sitting against the building wall with the shaft protruding from the meat of his deltoid and his eyes enormous and his mouth open and the sound he made the sound of a child discovering that the place he was in was the place where children were broken.

November fought. He went down twice more. The first time — an orc's shield rim catching him across the jaw, the impact snapping his head sideways and sending him into the barricade's timber bracing, the taste of blood flooding his mouth because his tongue had been between his teeth and the teeth had met through it. He spat. Got up. Swung. Missed. Swung again. Connected — the blade finding the orc's thigh, the cut deep enough to slow him, and one of the composite soldiers finished the orc with a spear thrust while November leaned against the barricade and breathed through the blood in his mouth.

The second time — the ground. Not a blow, not an orc. The ground itself, the cobblestones slick with blood and rain that had started falling at some point without November noticing, the water mixing with the blood to create a surface that his boots could not grip. His feet went. He went down hard — his hip, his ribs, the left arm catching under his body and the joint producing a sound that was not a sound but a colour, a shade of white that lived behind his eyes.

Edric pulled him up.

The blacksmith's hands. The grip that knew how to hold things that were heavy and hot and unwilling to be held. Edric's fingers closed on November's arm — the right arm, the working arm — and pulled, and November came up the way a drowned man came up, gasping, blinking, the surface of consciousness breaking over him in a wave of smoke and noise and the particular, intimate face of a boy who was twenty paces from the man he was becoming and might never reach the distance.

"Up," Edric said. The same word November had used with Brenn. The same certainty. The voice of a person who was not asking.

November stood.

He stood because Edric told him to. He stood because the compass told him to. He stood because standing was the thing he could do — the one ability he possessed that did not require training or skill or the vocabulary of violence that the soldiers around him spoke with a fluency he would never match. They were faster. They were stronger. Their blades found gaps that November's blade missed, their shields caught blows that November's absent shield could not, their bodies moved through the fighting with the grammar of trained warriors whose muscles knew the conjugations of combat the way November's muscles knew the conjugations of getting up.

They were better. They were always better. And they were dying.

The Legionnaire with the bandaged skull went down at the twenty-minute mark. An orc's axe found the gap between helmet and skull — the gap where the helmet had been and wasn't, the gap that the bandage covered and the bandage did not protect. He fell sideways, against the barricade, and his sword clattered and his body slid to the cobblestones and the sound he made was the sound Darya had made and the sound the orc in the rubble had made and the sound every body made when the making stopped: nothing. The absence of sound. The silence that was louder than screaming because screaming meant the body was still trying.

Thirteen had become nine. Nine became seven. Seven held.

November stood among them. The man with the borrowed sword. The civilian who had never been the best in any room and was not the best in this one and was *here* — present, standing, the sword in his hand and the blood on his face and the ribs that ground with each breath and the arm that hung like a broken pendulum and the eyes that were open and the compass that was pointing at the barricade and the barricade was where he was and where he was staying because the staying was what he did.

The soldiers saw him.

Not in the way they had seen him on Day 2 — the assessment, the civilian, the man without armour holding a dead man's sword. By Day 6, that assessment had been updated. The soldiers who remained — the composite fragments, the auxiliaries, the survivors of a garrison that had started at eight hundred and fifty and was now a number too small to calculate while fighting — had seen the civilian on the wall every day. Had seen him carry water and drag wounded and stand shifts that weren't his. Had seen him carry Brenn through the retreat. Had seen him go north when everyone went south, had seen him dig civilians from rubble with one hand, had seen him get hit and go down and get back up. And back up. And back up.

They did not follow him because he was good. They followed him because he was *there.*

In the hell of Day 6 — the smoke and the blood and the mathematics that said this position would fall in the next hour and the hour after that would be the last hour and the last hour would produce a number that would be carved into a memorial stone if anyone survived to carve — in that hell, the thing that would not break became magnetic. The soldiers gravitated toward November the way they gravitated toward the barricade: not because it was the strongest thing in the district, but because it was the thing that was still standing, and standing was the minimum requirement and the maximum hope and the only measurement that mattered.

November did not know this. He knew the compass. He knew the Creed. He knew the weight of the sword in his hand and the weight of the bodies that fell beside him and the weight of the breath in his lungs that cost more each time and was worth less each time and was still the breath that kept him vertical.

He fought on.

---

The barricade blew at the ninth bell.

The detonation came from below. Skrixx's charges — the goblin compound packed against the barricade's foundation, the chemical fusing that Dorran couldn't disarm, the ticking clock that had been waiting beneath their feet since before dawn. Three charges, simultaneous, the blast punching upward through the sewer tunnels and into the basalt blocks with a force that was not an impact but an erasure — the barricade that Dorran had built with precision and care and the knowledge that precision was the difference between a wall and a pile of rubble discovering that the difference no longer applied.

November was thrown.

Not far. Five paces — the blast wave and the debris carrying him backward and sideways and into the wall of the building behind the barricade, the impact landing him on his back in a shower of stone and timber and the fine, choking dust that filled the air the way water filled a vessel, completely, leaving no space for the thing the body needed to survive.

His ears were gone. The ringing — the same ringing from Day 1, from the blast that took Horus — filled the space where sound was supposed to be, and the world became visual, silent, the smoke and the rubble and the bodies around him moving in the muted, underwater quality of a place where the air had been replaced by something thicker.

He lay in the debris.

*Get up.*

He got up.

The barricade was gone. Not gone — transformed. The basalt blocks that had been a wall were scattered across the avenue, the timber bracing splintered, the position that thirteen men had held for forty minutes reduced to a field of rubble that stretched from building to building. The crossfire corridor was open. The approach was open. The district behind the barricade — the dormitories, the civilian shelters, the last position before the gate to the Inner Ring — was exposed.

The dust cleared enough to see.

Bodies. Three — four. The auxiliaries who had been at the centre of the barricade, closest to the blast point. They were not moving. The rubble covered them partially, the stone and timber settling over the shapes that had been people the way rubble settled over everything in the Anvil District: with finality, with the indifferent weight of material that did not care what it buried.

Edric was on his hands and knees. Ten paces away, against the far wall. His helmet was gone — knocked loose by the blast, the chin-strap broken, the iron shell lying in the rubble three paces from where his head would have been if the helmet had stayed on. His face was visible — the full face, unframed, the features that November had watched change for five days exposed in the dust-choked light. The blood ran from a cut above his left ear. His mouth was open, gasping, the lungs fighting for air that the blast had removed and the dust had replaced.

He was alive.

November moved toward him. The rubble shifted under his feet — the loose stone, the shattered timber, the surface that was no longer a surface but a field of debris that moved and settled and moved again with each step. His ribs screamed with each breath. His right hand still held Darya's sword — the fingers locked around the grip in the convulsive hold that had become permanent, the muscles no longer capable of releasing because the releasing required an instruction the body had stopped sending on Day 3.

"Edric."

The man — the boy — the person who was both and neither and who was on his hands and knees in the rubble of a barricade that had been his post for forty minutes and was now a memory shaped like debris — looked up.

"I'm up," Edric said. He wasn't. He was on his knees. But the words were the words, the same words November used, the same refusal, the same stubborn, grinding insistence that the position of the body was less relevant than the intention of the will.

Edric stood.

His legs shook. The deep shake — not the fine tremor from Day 2 but the full, structural vibration of a body that had been blast-concussed and was trying to remember how the mechanism of standing worked. He found his sword. Found his shield — the surface dented, scraped, the crimson crest scored with the marks of every blow it had taken since the staging area, a record of five days written in iron and paint.

He looked at November.

November looked back.

They did not speak. There was nothing to say that the moment did not already contain — the blown barricade, the dead, the orcs massing beyond the rubble field, the sound of the assault that was coming because the assault had been coming for six days and the six days had been leading to this and this was the place where it arrived.

---

The orcs came through the breach.

They came the way water came through a broken dam — not in formation, not in the disciplined waves of the first days, but in a surge, the mass of warriors pouring over the rubble where the barricade had been with the momentum of an army that had been hitting a wall for a week and had just watched the wall disintegrate. War-cries. Bone horns. The guttural, thundering sound of the Ironclaw horde in full assault, the sound that November had learned to hear beneath the other sounds, the bass note beneath the percussion, the frequency that said the thing coming was bigger than the space it was coming into.

Seven defenders.

November. Edric. Two composite soldiers. The woman with the strapped arm, who had regained consciousness and was on her feet with a sword she'd taken from one of the dead, one arm still bound, fighting because the alternative was lying in the rubble and the rubble was where the dead were. A Legionnaire who had come from the southern positions at the sound of the blast — a man November didn't know, young, the same age as Edric, his armour clean enough to suggest he'd been in reserve rotation. And Corporal Tesswin — Tesswin, who had held the northern barricade on Day 6's dawn, who had come south when the northern position fell, who was here because every position was here now, every section condensed into the single, remaining point of contact between the Ironclaw army and the gate to the Inner Ring.

Seven. Against the tide.

They formed a line. Not because someone ordered it — because the line was what soldiers made when the world required bodies between the enemy and the thing behind the bodies. The line was Tesswin, Edric, November, and the four others, spread across the avenue in the rubble of the blown barricade, their weapons up, their bodies the barricade now because the stone barricade was gone and the bodies were all that remained.

The first orc reached them.

Tesswin took him. Shield and sword, the precise, efficient violence of a woman who had been fighting for six days and had reduced combat to its essential components: block, thrust, step. The orc fell. Another came. Tesswin took him too.

Then the wave hit.

The line buckled. Not broke — buckled, the defenders driven back by the weight of the assault, feet sliding on the rubble, the force of the orc charge pressing them backward into the street behind the barricade's ruins. November was hit — a shield, driven into his chest by an orc who used it as a weapon, the iron rim striking his sternum and sending him staggering, his footing lost, the ground meeting him again with the intimacy of a surface he'd become familiar with.

He got up.

An orc's sword came down. November raised Darya's blade — the parry that was not a parry, the untrained motion that put steel between his head and the descending edge. The impact jarred through his arm. The orc's blade slid along his and the edge caught his forearm — right forearm, the working arm — and the cut opened the skin above the wrist in a line that was hot and immediate and produced blood that ran down his hand and mixed with the blood already there and made the grip slippery, the leather sliding under fingers that had no right to still be holding.

He didn't let go.

He swung. Missed. The orc was already past him — moving south, toward the dormitories, toward the civilians, toward the gate that was the last thing between the Ironclaw and the Inner Ring. November turned to follow and Edric was there — shield up, blocking the avenue, the boy planting himself in the path of the orc with the absolute, geometric certainty of a barrier that intended to remain where it was placed.

The orc hit Edric's shield. The impact drove Edric back two steps. His boots found purchase — the blacksmith's stance, the wide, rooted position of a man who had learned balance over an anvil before he learned it over a sword. He held. The shield held. Edric's sword came around the edge and the thrust was clean, fast, the trained motion that the boy had drilled a thousand times in the yard with Sergeant Mallow, and the orc fell.

November reached him. They stood together — shoulder to shoulder, the civilian and the Legionnaire, in the ruins of the barricade, in the rubble of the district that had already been destroyed twice and was being destroyed a third time.

"Hold here," Tesswin said. Her voice was the same compressed, authoritative sound that every section commander's voice became in the fighting — the voice that was not a person but a function, the command that existed to organise the chaos into something that could survive the next thirty seconds.

They held.

---

The fighting became something November's mind could not hold in sequence.

It came in fragments. Moments that existed independently, disconnected from the moments before and after, the chronology of combat breaking apart the way the barricade had broken apart — into pieces, into individual events, each one complete and isolated, the gaps between them filled with the white noise of a body operating beyond the limits of what consciousness could track.

A fragment: an orc cresting the rubble, his axe raised, and November stepping into the swing instead of away from it — *into* it, because into was where the axe wasn't yet, and the gap between the handle and the arc was a space he could occupy for the half-second it took to drive Darya's blade into the orc's belly above the belt. The blade went in. The orc's breath on November's face, hot and metallic. The eyes — brown, the same brown — going from alive to the anteroom. The weight of the body falling against him. The smell. Always the smell.

A fragment: Tesswin, fighting two orcs at once, her shield arm mechanics a thing of beauty in the ugliness — the shield moving between threats in a pattern that looked like thought but was faster than thought, the trained reflexes of a soldier who had been defending since Day 1. She killed one. The other cut her across the shoulder and she grunted and pivoted and killed him too and did not fall and did not stop and the not-stopping was the thing they all did now, the shared defiance of bodies that should have been done and were not.

A fragment: the young Legionnaire — the one from reserve rotation, the one with clean armour — taking a spear through the gap between his chest plate and his shoulder. The clean armour was not clean after that. He fell against the rubble and the sound he made was not the sound of a soldier dying but the sound of a person dying, and the difference was everything and nothing, and November could not help him because the next orc was already there and the next orc required the next swing and the swing was all he had.

A fragment: Edric. Shield up. Sword moving. The blacksmith's son fighting in the ruins of a district that his father's forge had been part of, in the rubble of a world that the firebombing had started destroying six months ago and the siege was finishing. Edric fought the way he did everything since Day 3 — with contained fear, with the settled certainty of a man who had decided that standing was what soldiers did and he was a soldier, and the deciding was stronger than the fear and the fear was there and the deciding was there and they coexisted the way the ring of an anvil coexisted with the heat of the forge.

Seven became five. Five held.

November went down again. A blow — he didn't see the source, an impact on the back of his head that turned the world to static, the grey-white interference pattern of a mind receiving too much information and discarding it in self-defense. He was on the cobblestones. The sky was above him. The sky was still wrong. It had been wrong for six days and it would be wrong for however many more minutes or hours remained, and the wrongness was the new constant, the baseline against which everything else was measured.

*Get up.*

He got up.

He didn't know how many times. The number had passed the point where counting served a purpose. Each time the ground received him. Each time the compass spoke. Each time his body — broken, bleeding, operational past the point where operational was a word that applied — found the vertical and stood in it and the standing was enough and enough was all there was.

The soldiers saw him get up. Each time. They saw the civilian go down and the civilian come back and the civilian was still there with his borrowed sword and his useless arm and his face that was blood and dust and the expression that was not courage because courage implied a choice and November had made the choice on Day 1 and every moment since was the execution of a decision that had already been decided.

They held. Because he stood. Because standing was magnetic. Because the thing that would not break drew people to it the way the compass drew November — not by force, not by command, but by the simple, gravitational truth that in a world where everything was falling, the thing that remained upright became the centre.

The wound found Edric at the tenth bell.

Not the first wound — he had taken cuts, impacts, the accumulated damage that the barricade fight distributed across every body in it like a tax the siege collected from anyone who hadn't paid enough yet. But the wound at the tenth bell was different. The wound at the tenth bell was the kind that separated the fighting from the dying.

November saw it happen.

An orc — larger than the others, broader across the chest, carrying a heavy sword in two hands, the kind of weapon that was not designed for technique but for mass, for the delivery of force in quantities that overcame whatever the recipient was doing. The orc came over the rubble at the junction where the barricade's remains met the building wall. The junction where the woman with the strapped arm had fought and where the woman with the strapped arm was no longer because the woman had been pushed back and the junction was open and the opening was where the orc came through.

Edric turned to meet him.

The shield came up. The trained response — the response that had saved November on Day 2 and Day 3 and Day 4 and every time Edric's body had placed itself between the civilian and the thing trying to kill him. The shield came up and the heavy sword came down and the impact was different — louder, deeper, the sound of force exceeding the tolerance of the arm holding the shield. Edric's shield arm buckled. The metal dented inward. The force drove through the shield and into the arm and Edric staggered — two steps, three — and his sword came around for the counter but the counter was slow, too slow, the arm that had taken the impact not sending the signals it needed to send to the hand that held the sword.

The orc struck again.

The blade caught Edric below the ribs. Left side. The gap between the cuirass and the hip guard, the inch of space that armour always left because armour was a compromise and compromises were measured in inches and inches were where the dying lived.

The sound Edric made was not a scream.

It was smaller than that. A grunt — the abbreviated, involuntary noise of a body receiving information it was not designed to receive. The blade was in him. November could see it — the dark metal against the crimson sash, the point of entry below the ribs, the depth that said the wound was not a cut but an intrusion, the sword having passed through the compromise and into the territory behind it where the mechanisms lived.

Edric's hand found the orc's arm. The blacksmith's grip — the grip that held things that were heavy and hot. He held the arm that held the sword that was in him, and the holding was not a technique and not a strategy, it was the raw, instinctive action of a body that had been penetrated and was responding the only way it knew: by gripping the thing that was hurting it and not letting go.

November hit the orc.

He came from the right — the same direction he'd come from on Day 2, the same artless, lateral assault that was all he knew, the full weight of his body behind Darya's sword. The blade caught the orc's neck above the gorget. The cut was ugly — the angle wrong, the edge turning on the muscle, the strike of a man who had never learned where to put the blade and was putting it everywhere and anywhere and the everywhere was sometimes enough. The orc staggered. Released the sword in Edric's side. Turned toward November.

Tesswin killed him.

The spear — she had picked up a spear from the dead, the efficient scavenging of a soldier who used whatever the battlefield provided — went through the orc's chest from behind. The point emerged from the front. The orc looked down at it with the expression that November had seen before — the anteroom expression, the look of a body discovering the interruption — and fell.

November dropped Darya's sword.

He caught Edric.

---

The weight.

The weight was not Edric's body — the body was lighter than Brenn's, lighter than the stones he'd moved in the dormitory, lighter than any of the physical weights the siege had asked him to carry. The weight was the knowledge. The weight was the sword still protruding from Edric's left side, the hilt moving with each breath, the motion that was a countdown measured in millimetres and the millimetres were the distance the body was travelling between alive and the anteroom.

November lowered him. Behind the rubble. Behind the line that Tesswin and the three remaining defenders were holding, the line that was not a barricade and not a wall but the bodies of four people who were doing what bodies did in the last stages of a siege: standing between the enemy and the thing behind them, spending the last of what they had to buy the minutes that the minutes cost.

Edric was on the cobblestones.

His back against a chunk of basalt. The basalt was Dorran's work — the same dwarven stone that had been the barricade, the stone that his father would have appreciated, the stone that the finest craft in Bloodhollow had produced and the siege had scattered like gravel. Edric's hand was on the hilt of the sword in his side, not pulling, not pushing — resting, the fingers around the leather grip in the hold of a man who knew what the thing was and knew that moving it would finish what holding still was delaying.

November knelt beside him.

"Don't," Edric said. His voice was the gravel rasp, but quieter — the volume turned down, the body conserving resources, redirecting from the voice to the places that needed it more, the heart and the lungs and the mechanisms that were trying to continue their function around the piece of metal that had interrupted the arrangement.

"Don't what?"

"Don't pull it out. I know—" A breath. Shorter than the last. "I know what that means."

November looked at the wound. The blade had entered below the ribs on the left side. The bleeding was steady, dark — not the bright arterial spray but the deep, organ-sourced flow that meant the damage was inside, in the places where the stitching was too complex and too critical and too far from any surgeon's hands to be reached.

He knew what it meant too.

He didn't say it. The Creed did not require him to say the things the moment already contained, and the moment contained everything — the sword, the blood, the boy's face in the dust-choked light, the sound of fighting ten paces away, the quality of the breathing that was changing the way the breathing always changed, shorter, more careful, the body rationing the air the way the garrison rationed supplies, each breath a resource being allocated to its highest priority.

"November." Edric's hand moved. Not toward the sword — toward November. The blacksmith's hand, the broad palm, the hammer calluses. The hand that had gripped his arm on Day 2 and pulled him up. The hand that had offered the binding cloth on Day 3. The hand that had carried Brenn's belt on Day 4. The hand that had shaped iron before it shaped itself around a sword.

November took it.

The grip was warm. Still strong — the strength of a boy who had grown up holding things that were heavy and hot and unwilling to be held, the strength that was in the hands regardless of what the rest of the body was doing, because the hands were the last thing to give and the blacksmith's son's hands had been forged for holding.

"My mother," Edric said. "And my sisters. The pension—"

"I know."

"Will you—"

"Yes."

The answer came before the question finished. The way the no had come before the sergeant's second command on Day 4. The compass did not require the full question. The compass knew what was being asked because what was being asked was what was always being asked — *will you stay, will you hold, will you carry the thing I cannot carry* — and the answer was the answer the compass always gave.

*We do not abandon.*

Edric's grip tightened. A fraction. The brown eyes — too wide for the walls on Day 2, narrowed and focused since Day 3, the eyes that had been learning what to look at and what to look away from — were on November's face. They were not wide now. They were not narrow. They were the eyes of a person who was looking at the thing he had chosen to look at in the last looking, and the thing was the face of the man who had grabbed an ankle and the man who had said *because the wall needs holding* and the man who had carried Brenn and who had not left and who was here.

"I said I'd be beside you," Edric said.

The words were the same. The same words from Day 2, from the rubble, from the moment when a nineteen-year-old boy with blood on his sword and tears on his cheeks had decided what he was. The words were the same and the weight was the same — the hammer falling, the ring of the anvil, the sound that went into the chest and into the bones and sat there.

November held his hand.

The fighting continued. Ten paces away, Tesswin and the survivors held the line, the sound of their holding a rhythm that November heard the way he heard everything now — from a distance that was not distance but attention, his attention narrowed to the hand in his, the breathing that was shorter, the eyes that were open.

"Tell my uncle—" A breath. Shorter still. The countdown reaching its final numbers. "Tell Kael I—"

The breath came in. It did not go out.

Edric's grip did not loosen. The blacksmith's hands — the last thing to give. The fingers stayed closed around November's, the warmth still there, the strength still there, the holding continuing past the point where the body behind the holding had stopped continuing.

November held the hand.

He held it the way he held the sword — too tight, the same mistake, the one she had diagnosed from a blister in a morning that belonged to a different world. He held it because the Creed said *we do not abandon* and abandonment was not only leaving, it was letting go, and letting go was the one thing the compass did not have a mechanism for.

Edric's eyes were open. The brown eyes. The same brown as the orc's on Day 2, the same brown as the earth, the colour of things that were alive and real and mortal. The thing behind them — the boy, the man, the blacksmith's son, the Legionnaire who had been afraid and willing, who had put his shield over a civilian in the rubble, who had said *I miss that sound* and *I know* and *then I'll be beside you* — the thing behind them went somewhere else.

November sat with him.

The way he had sat with Darya. The way he had sat with the widow in the Hall. The way he had learned from Horus — from the best — that the most important thing a person could do in the presence of another person's ending was to be there. Not to fix. Not to save. To hold the hand and keep the silence and let the weight of what had happened exist without trying to make it smaller.

A boy who should have been apprenticing at his father's forge. Who had enlisted because the pension wasn't enough. Whose father had been killed by the same man who now commanded the defense of the city that had taken everything from Edric Thane and then asked for his life as well, and the asking was the last line in a ledger that the war had been keeping since before the boy was born.

Nineteen years old.

November let go of his hand.

It was the hardest thing the compass had ever asked him to do. Harder than the training post, harder than the sobriety, harder than the blast, harder than the carry, harder than every time the ground received him and the compass said *get up.* Letting go was not the compass's instruction — the compass said *hold,* the Creed said *do not abandon.* But the letting go was not abandonment. The letting go was the acknowledgment that the holding was complete, that the thing the holding had protected was gone, and the gone was not a failure of the holding but the world's answer to the holding, and the world's answer was the thing it always was: the price.

He laid Edric's hand on his chest. Closed the eyes. The brown eyes that had been too wide for the walls.

He picked up Darya's sword.

He stood.

---

The compass spoke.

*Standing?*

Yes. In the rubble. In the ruins. In the Anvil District that had burned three times — the firebombing, the siege, and now the final assault — and was still burning. Standing the way a wall stood after its barricade was blown and its stones were scattered and the wall was no longer a wall but a man in the rubble with a sword he couldn't let go of and an arm that hadn't worked since Day 1 and ribs that turned every breath into a negotiation and a boy behind him whose hand was still warm and whose eyes were closed and whose father's anvil would never ring again.

*Sober?*

Six days. The bottle was a myth. The bottle belonged to a man who no longer existed — a man who had lived before the training post, before the Creed, before the morning with the heel of the bread and the light through the window and the voice that said *fix your sweep.* The man who held the sword was not the man who had held the bottle. The distance between them was measured in days and bodies and the specific, intimate knowledge of what it cost to hold a hand while the warmth left it.

*The Creed?*

He had not abandoned.

He had not abandoned Edric Thane, the blacksmith's son, the boy with the hammer calluses and the too-wide eyes and the sound he missed and the shield he put over the man on the ground. He had not abandoned him. He had held his hand while the holding ended and the ending was not November's failure — it was the war's price, the cost that the machine collected from the people it consumed, the currency of innocence spent by a system that fed boys into its teeth and called the feeding necessity.

*Did I live the Creed?*

The answer was not clean. The answer was five bodies behind the barricade that was not a barricade anymore. The answer was Edric's closed eyes. The answer was the soldiers to the north on Day 5 who might have lived if November had gone to them instead of the civilians. The answer was every choice that had a cost and every cost that was paid by someone who didn't choose to pay it.

The answer was: he was standing. The answer was: he had not left. The answer was: the people he could reach, he had reached. The people he couldn't, he carried. The Creed was not a scorecard and not a balance sheet and not a mechanism that produced clean answers. The Creed was a direction. The compass pointed at it. He walked toward it. The walking was the living.

He looked at Edric one more time. The face that had settled. The jaw that had set. The armour that fit because the boy inside it had decided what he was.

Then November Falls turned toward the fighting.

The sound was closer. The orcs were through the secondary barricade's ruins and pressing south, toward the dormitories, toward the civilians, toward the gate. Tesswin was falling back — an organised withdrawal, fighting for each foot of ground, the corporal doing what corporals did in the final stages: spending time with space, trading the avenue's length for the minutes the gate needed to hold.

November walked toward her.

He walked with the stride of a man who had nothing left. Nothing in the way the word meant empty — no reserves, no strength, no fuel, the body's tank dry, the mechanism running on the fumes of fumes. But nothing in another way too. Nothing to lose. The thing he'd been afraid of losing — the boy beside him, the bond that five days had built — was lost. The thing he'd always been afraid of losing — the healer, the morning, the woman who had shown him that fixing was possible — was already gone. The things that remained were the things that could not be taken: the Creed. The compass. The refusal.

He reached the line. Tesswin looked at him — the assessment, the fast inventory of damage and capacity. Her eyes moved to the rubble behind him, where Edric's body was. She didn't ask. She had been in enough fights to know what the absence of a man beside another man meant.

"Hold here," she said. "The gate detail is pulling civilians through. We need five minutes."

Five minutes. The number was a fiction — five minutes of holding an open avenue against an army that had breached every position, blown the barricade, and was pouring south with the momentum of a force that smelled the end. Five minutes might as well have been five hours or five years. The number was irrelevant. The holding was all.

November stood in the line.

Five defenders. One of them him. The worst fighter in every room, in every line, on every wall. The man who swung late and hit wrong and went down more than he stood and whose left side was a gap that a child with a stick could exploit.

He raised Darya's sword.

Too tight. The same mistake.

The orcs came.

November Falls did not leave.
