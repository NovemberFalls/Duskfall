# CHAPTER TWELVE: THE PRICE OF FEEDING

## Day 3 — The Grind

---

The food ran out faster than the warriors.

Thokk stood over the supply pits and counted what remained. The quartermaster — an old she-orc named Durra who had been feeding armies since before Thokk earned his first scar — stood beside him with the patience of a woman who had already done the arithmetic and was waiting for him to finish doing it wrong.

The pits were shallow trenches dug into the ridge's western slope, lined with hide to keep the rain out and covered with timber to keep the crows off. Three days ago, they had held enough grain and dried meat and salt fish to feed twenty-five hundred for twelve days. Twelve days was the number Durra had given him before the march, the number she had calculated from the stores they carried and the foraging they could do and the wild game the scouts brought in. Twelve days. The siege would be over in twelve days, one way or another.

Three days in, the pits were half empty.

"How," Thokk said.

Durra looked at him. She had a face like a cliff — sheer, weathered, the features worn by time into something that was less a face and more a landscape. Her tusks were grey, the ivory thinned by decades of use, and her eyes held the particular clarity of a woman who had spent her life measuring things and had never once been surprised by the answer.

"Da army's bigger dan we planned for."

"Da army is da size I said it would be."

"Da army eats more dan ya said it would."

Thokk looked at the pits. He knew what she meant. Twelve days had been calculated for an army on the march — warriors covering ground, burning energy at the steady, manageable rate of people who walked and rested and walked again. An army in a siege burned differently. The fighting consumed muscle the way the forge consumed coal — fast, hot, the body demanding fuel at a rate that a march never touched. Warriors who fought on the wall all day and carried their dead all night needed twice the ration of warriors who walked.

He had known this. He had known it the way he knew every truth he had chosen to carry without speaking: silently, privately, the knowledge stored in the locked room behind his ribs where the things that would break morale lived.

"How long?"

"Six days at current ration. Four if ya keep feeding dem double portions after da fighting."

Six days. Grimtusk had said two winters. The siege was supposed to take less than one.

"Cut da ration," Thokk said.

"To what?"

"March ration. Same as da road. Da warriors fight on what dey marched on."

Durra's jaw moved. The same motion Gharza made when she was chewing on something she wanted to spit.

"Dey marched on full bellies and fresh kills, Blood-Chief. Dey're fighting on three days of siege. Da body knows da difference even if da orders don't."

"Den da body learns."

"Bodies don't learn. Dey break."

Thokk looked at her. Durra did not blink. She was not a warrior — she had never held a weapon, never stood on a wall, never felt the collision of iron against iron that turned the world into a single, screaming point. But she had fed the warriors who did those things for forty years, and in forty years she had learned a truth that most War-Chiefs never reached: an army's strength lived in its belly, not its arms.

"March ration," he said. "And send da scouts. Dere's game in da valley. Not much, but enough to supplement."

Durra turned and walked toward the cook fires. She moved the way Grimtusk moved — deliberately, with the weight of decades and the understanding that arguing with a Warlord was like arguing with weather. You said your piece and then you lived with the result.

Thokk watched her go.

Six days. At march ration, with whatever game the scouts could drag from a valley that the siege was turning into wasteland. Six days of food for an army that was dying faster than it was eating.

He thought about the children at Bloodtide Bay. The thin faces. The ribs you could count through the hide wrappings when the winter stripped the fat from everyone under ten. His wife's voice, the last words: *the children needed to eat.*

This was what the siege cost. Not warriors — he had warriors. Not time — time was a ledger entry, a number that decreased at a rate he could measure. The siege cost food, and food was the thing the Ironclaw did not have, and the thing the city behind those walls did have, and the distance between the two was measured in bodies stacked in the killing ground and spirits that screamed through a door that was closing.

---

The War-Chiefs came at midday.

The council fire was cold — Thokk had ordered the fires banked during daylight to conserve fuel, and the council met around the dead ash of last night's flames with the sun pressing down on them through the smoke-haze that the siege had draped across the valley like a second sky.

They looked worse than yesterday. Three days of siege did that. The freshness of the first morning — the sharp, coiled readiness of warriors who had marched for three months and were finally facing what they'd marched for — was gone. What replaced it was the particular, heavy weariness that came from sustained violence, the weight that settled into the shoulders and the jaw and the space behind the eyes where sleep used to live.

Krogan's scalp wound had been stitched. The thread was black — gut, the standard, the wound pulled closed with the blunt efficiency of a shaman who had too many patients and not enough time. His face was grey beneath the green, the pallor of blood loss that had not yet been recovered. His eldest son's absence sat beside him like a body.

Gharza was unwounded. She was always unwounded — the western approach had not seen full engagement, and Gharza's role was pressure, not assault. She wore the unwoundedness the way another woman might have worn guilt — silently, uncomfortably, aware that her body's wholeness was an accident of assignment rather than a measure of her willingness to bleed.

Malga's arm was worse. The crude bandaging from Day 2 had been replaced by a shaman's wrap, but the blood still seeped through in the slow, persistent way that said the wound was deep and the healing was being interrupted every time she raised the arm to give an order. She did not mention it. She never mentioned the things that hurt her. That was what made the things that hurt her worse.

Urzag sent a runner again. A different runner — the first one had been assigned to the eastern tunnel, and the tunnel had collapsed, and the runner was now part of the rubble that Skrixx's goblins were clearing. The new runner stood at the edge of the dead fire and delivered Urzag's count: reserve intact. No engagement. War-beasts fed and watered.

Four words from Urzag. Four more than his usual.

"Day three," Thokk said.

He did not stand. Today, he sat with them. Not from exhaustion — though the exhaustion was there, lodged in his joints and his spine the way the cracked wolf knuckle was lodged in his pouch. He sat because sitting was a different kind of authority. Standing said: *I am above you.* Sitting said: *I am with you, and what I am about to say requires us to be in the same place.*

"Losses."

He gave them the numbers because the numbers deserved to be spoken. Twenty-two Ironclaw dead since the pyres. The probing attacks — the constant, shifting pressure that the human commander had adopted on Day 3 — cost less per engagement but cost continuously, the way a slow bleed costs less than a wound but kills you the same.

Total Ironclaw dead after three days: one hundred and sixty-seven. Effective strength: one thousand and thirty-three.

Goblin losses: Skrixx had reported separately, in the terse, transactional accounting that goblins favoured. Eighteen more dead since Day 2. Tunnel collapses. Counter-fire. One catapult crew consumed by their own alchemist's fire when a clay pot cracked in the cradle. Total goblin dead: forty-nine. Effective goblin strength: seven hundred and fifty-one.

The Revenants: five hundred. Untouched. Standing at the edge of the camp with the patience of things that had no deadline and no appetite and no investment in the outcome beyond the instinct that pulled them toward the dying the way flies pulled toward meat.

"Da wall," Thokk said. "It's holding."

No one contradicted him. The wall was holding because walls held. That was what walls did — they stood between the people who wanted in and the people who wanted to keep them out, and the only way through was to spend enough blood to break them, and the question was whether you had enough blood to spend.

"Malga. Gate report."

"Da rune-wards are fading." Malga flexed her wounded arm — not testing it, bracing it. "My scouts on da ridge can see da glow. Dimmer every day. Da eastern bastion is almost dark. Da gate itself is still lit but it's thinner. Like watching a candle through glass."

"Timeline?"

"Skrixx says one more day on da eastern bastion. Da wards spend themselves under bombardment. Once dey're gone, da stone is just stone, and stone breaks."

Stone breaks. Thokk turned the phrase over. Stone breaks and walls fall and armies pour through and the thing that protected the people inside becomes rubble, and the rubble becomes the thing you fight over, and the fighting in rubble was worse than the fighting on walls because rubble didn't have a top and a bottom — it had angles, and angles killed from every direction.

He had seen it at Stonehaven. He did not want to see it here.

"Krogan. Eastern assault."

Krogan spoke from the place behind his grief — the space where duty and loss shared a room and neither one acknowledged the other.

"We hit da eastern wall four times today. Probing — small groups, fast, testing da response. Da humans have shortened deir watches. More men on da wall at any given time. Less rest between shifts." He paused. "Dey're grinding deir own people down to keep da wall thick."

"How many did dey lose?"

"Hard to count from outside. My warriors killed — maybe twelve, fifteen today. Could be more. Da humans clear deir dead faster dan we do. Dey don't leave bodies on da wall."

Fifteen human dead. Against twenty-two Ironclaw. The ratio was wrong. At the walls, the defenders had the advantage of stone and height and the architecture of killing that the humans had spent decades perfecting, and the ratio reflected it — two orc dead for every human, sometimes three.

In the streets, after the wall fell, the ratio would change. But the wall had to fall first.

"Gharza."

"Da sappers are forty feet under da western wall." Gharza sat with her arms on her knees, her split jaw moving in the slow, ruminative rhythm of a woman who was always chewing on something. "Skrixx says dey're past da sealed section. Da human engineers packed it wit mortar and stone but da goblins are clearing it — slow, quiet, no charges. He doesn't want da listening posts to pick up da vibrations."

"Do dey know?"

"Da humans?" Gharza shrugged. "Dey doubled deir listening teams today. Krogan's scouts saw da relief crews going to da western towers. Dey know something is down dere. Dey don't know how close."

This was the gamble. The tunnels were Skrixx's play — the goblin approach, the way beneath, the answer to a wall that was too strong to go through and too high to go over. If the sappers reached the western foundation and placed charges at the base, the wall would come down from below, and the breach would be wide enough for three hundred warriors to pour through in the first minute, and the humans on the wall above would be standing on air.

If the tunnels collapsed — if the goblins hit bad rock or the human engineers dropped counter-charges or the ground simply refused to hold the weight of ambition — then the gamble was lost and the Ironclaw had spent three days of digging on a hole in the ground that killed the diggers and delivered nothing.

"Tell Skrixx his sappers stay quiet. No charges until da wards on da eastern bastion are spent. I want both at once — da eastern wall goes dark and da western wall goes down. Same hour if he can manage it."

Gharza nodded.

---

Skrixx came after the War-Chiefs left.

He arrived the way he always arrived — fast, angular, trailing smoke-smell like a wake. His burns had added a new chapter since yesterday — a raw patch on his left forearm where the alchemist's fire from the cracked clay pot had splashed, the skin shiny and wet with the salve his apprentices applied and that he ignored.

"I need more timber," Skrixx said.

"Ya always need more timber."

"Da Jawbreaker's arm cracked again. Same fracture. Da wood we used — da stuff from da valley floor — it's green. Green wood flexes under load. Good for bows. Bad for siege engines. I need seasoned timber. Hard timber. Da kind dat grows in da highlands, not da valley."

"Da highlands are three days' march."

"I know where da highlands are. I also know where da Jawbreaker is. It's in da flats, cracked, and every hour I spend fixing it wit bad wood is an hour da eastern bastion wards are not being hit."

Thokk looked at him. The goblin stood barely higher than his chest — a creature of angles and burns and the particular, feverish intelligence that made goblins either brilliant or dead and, in Skrixx's case, both. His copper eyes moved in the way they always moved — too fast, processing information at a rate that outpaced the conversation and left the speaker feeling like a man trying to explain something to a machine that had already solved the problem and was waiting for the input to catch up.

"Ya said da eastern wards fall in one more day."

"Wit sustained bombardment. Sustained bombardment requires da Jawbreaker. Da Jawbreaker requires timber dat doesn't crack. Do ya see da problem, Blood-Chief, or should I draw it?"

Thokk did not react to the insolence. Skrixx's value was measured in walls broken, not manners observed, and the calculation was simple: the goblin was rude and effective, and Thokk would tolerate the first because he needed the second.

"Use da timber from da outer palisade. Da forward camp doesn't need walls — we're not defending, we're attacking."

Skrixx blinked. The rapid, copper-bright flutter that said the goblin's mind was recalculating.

"Palisade timber. Seasoned from da march. Three months of sun and wind." His head tilted. "It'll work. Not ideal — da grain runs lateral instead of longitudinal — but it'll hold for da two, three days I need."

"Den take it."

"I need crews."

"Take da crews from da palisade teardown. Gharza's reserve can assist."

Skrixx paused. The pause was longer than his usual pauses, which meant it was nearly a full second.

"I also need more alchemist's fire. Da catapult loads are at forty per cent. Da bombardment eats dem faster dan my mixers can produce, and da mixers lost two crews yesterday when a batch went wrong." He hesitated — a thing Skrixx rarely did, the calculation encountering a variable it couldn't reduce. "I need sulphur. And I need it from da city's stores, because da supply we carried is gone."

"Da city's stores are behind da wall dat ya haven't broken yet."

"I'm aware of da geographic difficulty."

Thokk let the silence sit. The fire pit between them held nothing but cold ash, and the ash was grey, and the grey was the colour of everything the siege produced — smoke, bone-ash, exhaustion, the thinning line between what they had and what they needed.

"Can yer catapults operate on what ya have?"

"At reduced rate. Instead of six loads per hour, I can sustain three. Maybe four."

"Den sustain four. And when da wall breaks, yer people go in first to da supply stores. Da sulphur, da alchemy, whatever da humans have — it's yers."

Skrixx's eyes narrowed. The calculation completed.

"Ya're saying my payment for breaking da wall is da contents of da wall."

"I'm saying ya eat what ya kill."

The goblin stared at him for a moment. Then the grin — the unsettling, too-many-teeth expression that was Skrixx's version of professional satisfaction.

"Acceptable."

He turned to leave. Stopped.

"Blood-Chief."

Thokk waited.

"Da humans repositioned deir ballista on tower three today. It's targeting my engine positions instead of da ladder supply. Dey're prioritising my machines over yer warriors." The copper eyes held something that was not concern — concern was a luxury goblins did not trade in — but something adjacent. Recognition. "Dat means deir commander knows da wall falls from da engines, not da ladders. He's smart."

"I know he's smart."

"Smart and desperate. Dat's a dangerous combination."

Skrixx left. The smoke-smell dissipated slowly, replaced by the wind and the cook-fire residue and the underlying stink of a camp that had been stationary for three days in a valley that was beginning to smell like a siege smelled: blood, waste, the sweet undertone of decomposition that no amount of burial or burning could fully eliminate.

---

Thokk walked to the ridge in the late afternoon.

He walked alone. Not because the camp was unsafe — the camp was as safe as any place could be within artillery range of a city that had war-mages and ballistas and the disciplined, focused hatred of people who were fighting for their homes. He walked alone because the ridge was the place where he thought, and thinking was a thing he could not do with other people present, because other people required the Warlord, and the Warlord was a function, and the function did not think — it decided.

Thokk needed to think before he decided.

He stood where he had stood on the first night — the same outcrop, the same view, the same city below him with its three rings and its smoking forges and its wall that would not break.

The wall was different now. Three days of bombardment and assault had scarred it — the eastern section showed the dark patches where siege rounds had hit, the stone fractured, the rune-wards flickering in the afternoon light like a fire running out of fuel. The Sundered Gate still stood, the iron slab unmarked by anything the rams had delivered, but the bastions on either side showed the wear — cracks running through the mortar, the stone chipped and pitted, the architecture of defense being subtracted from by the mathematics of siege.

Behind the wall, the outer ring burned. The scattered fires that his warriors' assault had started and the human defenders' countermeasures had failed to extinguish sent plumes of grey and black into the haze, and the haze was thicker today — the accumulation of three days of fire and dust and the particular, acrid stink of alchemist's residue that clung to everything the goblin weapons touched.

Thokk watched the wall.

He could see the defenders. From this distance, they were shapes — the dark figures moving along the parapet, the flash of metal as a blade caught the light, the steady, methodical activity of men repairing and reinforcing and doing the same work he was doing on this side of the wall: preparing for tomorrow by surviving today.

They were fighting with desperation.

He had seen it on Day 1 — the ferocity of the defense at the Veil's Throat, the archers whose discipline turned the corridor into a slaughter, the gate that would not yield. He had named it then: *dey fight like dey've got nowhere to go.* And that had been true. They had nowhere to go. The wall was their world, and the world was shrinking.

But today, on Day 3, the desperation looked different. Not the white-hot, adrenaline-fueled resistance of men facing the first shock. Something cooler. Harder. The desperation of men who had absorbed the shock and survived it and were now settling into the grinding, endurance-based war that sieges became after the first blood was spent.

He recognised it.

He recognised it because it lived in him. The same cold calculation — the same weighing of what remained against what was needed, the same knowledge that the numbers did not add up and the same decision to continue regardless. The same willingness to spend everything on a chance that was not good enough but was the only chance there was.

*Da enemy is a mirror.*

The thought arrived uninvited, and Thokk did not push it away. He let it sit. The human commander on that wall was doing what Thokk was doing — counting dead, rationing food, repairing walls, making the decisions that commanders made because someone had to make them and the making killed something inside the maker that could not be rebuilt. Two men. Two sides. Both burning their people to fuel a war that neither of them had chosen and neither of them could stop.

At Stonehaven, the enemy had been dwarves. Stubborn, proud, fighting from tunnels with the mechanical precision of a people who built their defenses the way they built their weapons — to last. Thokk had respected them. But respect was simple. Respect was the warrior's gift to the worthy opponent, the acknowledgment that the enemy had earned his death.

This was not respect. This was recognition.

The human commander — the shape on the rampart, the figure he could not quite see through the haze — was not an enemy to be respected. He was a reflection. A man standing on the other side of a mirror, making the same choices, carrying the same weight, arriving at the same conclusion: *there is no backward.*

That unsettled him. Respect he could carry. Recognition he could not. Because recognition said that the difference between Thokk Ironhide and the man on the wall was not conviction or courage or cause. It was position. Geography. Which side of the stone you happened to be standing on when the killing started.

If Thokk had been born human, he would be on that wall. If the human commander had been born orc, he would be on this ridge. And the war would look exactly the same.

He touched the pouch at his belt. The cracked wolf knuckle beside the old Warlord's skull. The bone and the bone. The weight of what came before and the weight of what was coming.

Seven. The number still lived in Grimtusk's readings, persistent, uninterpretable, carrying its shadow. Thokk did not think about seven. He thought about food. About the six days of march ration in the pits. About the children at Bloodtide Bay, who did not know about the siege and did not care about the wall and did not understand the arithmetic that their father was running on the ridge above a city that smelled like death. They understood hunger. They understood the winter that was coming. They understood that their father had marched away to bring them food, and if he failed, the food did not come, and the winter did not care about walls or warriors or the mirrors that lived between enemies.

The children needed to eat.

That was the price of feeding. Not the grain in the pits or the salt fish in the stores or the wild game the scouts might drag from a valley that was emptying as fast as the supply trenches. The price of feeding was the warriors he spent to break the wall, so that the wall's stores could feed the children who were not here, who would never see the blood that paid for their bread.

The arithmetic was simple. The arithmetic was always simple. The execution was where the cost lived.

Thokk watched the wall until the light changed. He watched the defenders move along the parapet, and the shape on the rampart who stood where commanders stood, and the ward-light that flickered on the eastern bastion like a heartbeat that was learning to stop.

Then he turned from the ridge and walked down to his people.

The council fire needed relighting. The rations needed distributing. The wounded needed tending. The dead from today's probing attacks needed marking and burning and speaking to, because the dead deserved the words and the words deserved to be spoken by the man who sent them.

Tomorrow the eastern wards would fail. Tomorrow, or the day after, the wall would break.

And when it broke, the Ironclaw would pour through, and the fighting would move from the wall to the streets, and the streets would be worse, and the cost would be higher, and the food behind the wall would be worth every body stacked in the killing ground.

Or it wouldn't. And the Ironclaw would die here, on a ridge above a city that smelled like their funeral pyre, and the children at Bloodtide Bay would wait for a father who did not return, and the winter would come, and the winter did not negotiate.

The dark came in behind him.

The same dark. The same ridge. The same war.

And the children needed to eat.
