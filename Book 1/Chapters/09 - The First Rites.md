# CHAPTER NINE: THE FIRST RITES

## Day 2 — After the First Assault

---

The dying did not wait for him.

They had been arriving since dawn — carried, dragged, loaded onto carts that creaked under the weight of men who had been standing on the wall six hours ago. The triage stations in the Anvil District were canvas and timber, street corners turned into something that resembled medicine. Three of them, spaced along the main road between the secondary gate and the Hall of the Fallen. Kael had blessed the ground before they were built, traced the sigils of Tyr's protection in consecrated oil on the corner posts, and the wards had settled into the wood the way all wards settled — quietly, with a weight that existed in the space between faith and physics.

The wards did not stop the bleeding. They were not designed to.

He walked through the first station. The smell hit before the sight — not blood, which he knew. This was fresh blood layered over cautery. Seared flesh. The method the surgeons used when the bleeding would not stop and the alternative was letting a man bleed out on the floor.

He moved between the pallets. They were arranged in rows — military precision applied to the aftermath of military failure.

"Inquisitor."

A surgeon. Middle-aged. Her apron dark from collar to hem with the particular shade of brown that blood becomes when it has been wiped and wiped again. Her hands were steady. Her eyes were not.

"Sister. How many?"

"Forty-seven in this station. Twelve critical. The rest are—" She breathed. "Manageable. We've lost three since dawn."

Three. Kael received the number the way he received all numbers now — as weight.

"Have they received rites?"

The expression was not reproach. It was fatigue — the face of a woman who had been cutting and stitching and cauterising for six hours.

"They received what we could give them. Our hands and our skill and whatever we have left of the good bandages." A pause. "The rites are your department, Inquisitor."

"Yes. They are."

He knelt beside the first body.

---

The soldier's name was Brennan. He learned this from the man beside him — a Legionnaire with a bandaged leg and a face the colour of ash, watching the dead man on the next pallet with the fixed stare of someone looking at his own future.

"Brennan. Corporal. Sixth section. Took a spear under the arm on the parapet." He swallowed. "Couldn't stop the bleeding."

Kael looked at the dead man. Thirty, perhaps. The face had settled into the smooth emptiness that death brought, the muscles releasing their lifelong habit of expression and leaving behind a surface that was no longer a face so much as the memory of one.

He placed his hand on the dead man's forehead.

"*Tyr, Lord of Judgment, receive thy servant.*"

The Rite of Last Passing. He had spoken these words over bodies in the Cathedral's quiet rooms, in the Shrine of the Martyrs. He had spoken them over his father. Always in the measured cadence of a man who understood that the words were not for the dead but for the living who remained.

"*The Scales weigh thy deeds. The faithful do not place their thumb upon them. What thou hast done is counted. What thou hast given is measured. Go now to the silence beyond the silence, where judgment awaits and justice prevails.*"

The silence answered.

The Legionnaire with the bandaged leg watched. His expression had not changed — the fixed, flat stare of a man observing a ritual he had no opinion about because opinions required energy.

Kael withdrew his hand.

He moved to the second body.

---

By midday he had administered last rites to seven men.

Seven names. Brennan, Dask, Harwell, Torren, a woman whose tags read *Pvt. Anneke Marsh*, a man with no tags whose face the surgeons had covered, and a boy.

The boy was the seventh.

Fifteen. Perhaps sixteen. He wore the grey tunic of the auxiliary corps — not a Legionnaire, not trained, one of the men and women and children pressed into service when the garrison's numbers proved insufficient. He had taken an arrow through the chest. The shaft had been cut short but the point remained — buried in the lung, the surgeon said, in a voice that was clinical in the way voices become when the clinical is the only thing between the speaker and the thing they cannot afford to feel.

He was still alive.

His breathing was the sound of a bellows with a hole in it — the rasp and whistle of air moving through passages that were no longer sealed, each breath a negotiation between the body's insistence on continuing and the wound's insistence that it stop. His eyes were open. Not focused — the pupils wide, seeing something that was either the ceiling or the place the dying went when the body was still anchoring them to the world they were leaving.

Kael knelt.

The boy's hand moved. Not reaching — smaller than that, the involuntary twitch of fingers that had lost the strength to grip but not the impulse. The hand opened and closed on the pallet, grasping air. Kael felt something shift behind his ribs. Not a crack. A settling — the way a building settles when the foundation takes a weight it was not designed for.

He took the boy's hand.

The fingers closed around his. Weak. The grip of a child, not a soldier. Whatever the auxiliary corps had made of this boy, the fingers remembered what they had been — the fingers of someone who should have been apprenticing, or fishing, or doing any of the hundred things that fifteen-year-olds did in a world that was not currently feeding them into a wall.

"*Tyr, Lord of Judgment, attend thy servant.*"

His voice did not waver. His hands did not shake. The discipline held because the discipline was designed to hold — twenty-eight years of practice, built for exactly this moment, a man in black robes kneeling beside a dying child offering the words the institution had provided.

"*The Scales weigh thy deeds. The faithful do not place their thumb upon them—*"

The boy's lips moved.

Kael stopped.

Not a sound — the bellows-breathing consumed the air before it could become speech. But the shape was familiar, the movement of mouth and tongue forming a word he knew.

"*Mum.*"

The boy's hand tightened on Kael's. A spasm — the grip that was not a grip but a reflex, the body's last assertion of the need to hold and be held, the animal impulse that preceded prayer and outlasted it.

Kael held on.

"*What thou hast done is counted.*"

He spoke the words into the boy's face, into the wide unseeing eyes, into the space between a mouth trying to say *mum* and ears that could no longer carry the word home.

"*What thou hast given is measured.*"

The breathing slowed. The whistle faded. The negotiation between body and wound was ending, and the wound was winning.

"*Go now to the silence beyond the silence—*"

The hand went slack.

Not all at once. In stages. The thumb first. Then the smallest finger. Then the rest, one by one, a sequence that lasted no more than three seconds and contained, in those three seconds, the entire distance between alive and not.

He held the hand anyway.

"*Where judgment awaits and justice prevails.*"

The words left his mouth and the silence received them.

The boy was dead.

He was fifteen.

---

Kael folded the hands across the chest — the traditional arrangement, the gesture that said the body's work was done. He stood. His knees ached. The old complaint, the same price of kneeling. But the Cathedral's floor was black marble. This was packed earth and blood-soaked canvas and the smell of cautery and iron.

He looked at the boy.

*Tyr.*

Not a prayer. Not a petition. The name, placed into the silence without wrapper or form. A raw syllable directed at a god who had not answered.

*He was fifteen and he died with his mother's name in his mouth and your name in his ears and neither of us helped him.*

He closed his eyes. The discipline reasserted itself — not instantly, not cleanly, but with the grinding persistence of a system built to function under load. The thoughts were filed. The feeling behind the ribs was catalogued and moved to the place where feelings were kept when the day demanded function over sensation.

He opened his eyes.

The triage station continued. Around him, the surgeons worked. The wounded produced their sounds. The living moved among the dying with the steady efficiency of people who had found the rhythm of catastrophe and were riding it the way a man rides a current — not by choosing the direction but by not drowning.

Kael moved on.

---

The afternoon took him to the secondary gate between the middle ring and the outer ring, where the wounded came through and the dying were sorted.

He stood at the gate and watched them come. Stretchers. Carts. Soldiers walking with the rigid, careful posture of men whose bodies had been opened and who understood that stopping was the same as falling.

He blessed them as they passed. The Ward of the Threshold — a gesture and a word. *Tyr's judgment shield thee. Tyr's mercy sustain thee. Pass and be counted.*

Most did not look at him. They moved through his words the way they moved through the gate — as a feature of the landscape, the man in black robes doing what men in black robes did while the men in armour did what men in armour did, the two activities occupying the same space without intersecting.

A few looked. A Legionnaire with a gash across his scalp that had been bound with a strip of his own cloak — he looked at Kael as the blessing fell, and his eyes held the raw, undressed need of a man who wanted the words to be true and did not have the energy to examine whether they were.

Kael held the look. The need in those eyes was the thing he was here to answer, and the answer was the Rite, and the Rite was what he had.

The Legionnaire passed.

More came. The stream was steady — not the flood of a rout, not the trickle of a lull, but the constant flow of a siege grinding through its second day, producing casualties at a rate the triage stations could manage but not reduce.

---

The dying soldier found him at the third bell.

A Legionnaire — crimson sash, gate garrison insignia. He had been carried in by two men who set him down with the careful motion of people handling something that might break further. The wound was visible through the gap in his cuirass: a deep lateral cut across the abdomen. The sutures were rough, field-grade, the ugly stitching of emergency medicine. But the blood was still coming. Slowly, steadily — the dark seep that said the wound was deeper than the stitches and the bleeding was internal and the clock the surgeons were racing had already finished its count.

Kael knelt.

"Inquisitor." The soldier's voice was too clear. Too calm. The voice of a man whose body had passed through pain and arrived at the other side, where pain was a fact rather than a sensation and the fact was that it would not end until he did.

"I am here."

"I know." Grey eyes. Steady. The face of a man in his thirties who had served long enough to know what the wound in his belly meant. "I can feel it. It's not stopping."

"No," Kael said.

He did not lie. The curriculum permitted consolation — *the surgeons are skilled, the body is strong, Tyr's mercy is boundless* — but here, with the smell of the wound and the colour of the man's face and the slow dark seep, hope was a decoration applied to a fact. The soldier deserved better than decoration.

"Would you hear the Rite?"

A long look. The grey eyes measured something — not Kael's face, not his robes, but something behind them, in the space where the words would come from and the silence would follow.

"Yes."

Kael placed his hand on the soldier's forehead. The skin was cool. Not cold — not yet — but the warmth was receding.

"*Tyr, Lord of Judgment, attend thy servant.*"

But this time, the soldier spoke with him.

Not the Rite — the Soldier's Invocation, the simpler prayer the Legionnaires were taught, the dozen words that were all the theology the military provided its men:

"*Tyr, judge me fair. I held the wall. I did not run. Count my blood among the just.*"

The two prayers overlapped. Kael's formal passage and the soldier's blunt, twelve-word appeal, layered like two voices singing different melodies in the same key. Not harmony. Collision — the institutional prayer and the personal one, the theology and the desperation, the twenty-eight years of training and the dying man's lifetime of belief compressed into a dozen words because a dozen words were all he had left.

"*The Scales weigh thy deeds—*"

"*I held the wall.*"

"*The faithful do not place their thumb upon them—*"

"*I did not run.*"

"*What thou hast done is counted—*"

"*Count my blood among the just.*"

The soldier's voice faded. Not stopped — faded, the way a sound fades when the source is moving away though neither has moved. The words thinned. His eyes, which had been fixed on Kael's face with grey determination, began to unfocus.

"*What thou hast given is measured. Go now to the silence beyond the silence, where judgment awaits and justice prevails.*"

The soldier died. Quietly. A breath followed by no breath — the machinery of the body ceasing because the damage was too complete and the clock had finished its count.

Kael's hand was on his forehead. The skin was cooling under his palm.

He completed the final gesture — the sign of the Scales traced in the air above the body, two open palms held level to represent the balance that weighed all things.

The silence received it.

*The prayer didn't save him.*

The thought arrived uninvited. He had spoken the most sacred words he knew into the face of a dying soldier while the soldier spoke his own prayer and neither prayer had done what prayers were supposed to do, which was —

What were prayers supposed to do?

He knew the answer. Prayers were not petitions for intervention. They were offerings. The act of prayer was the thing itself — the discipline, the surrender, the trust that the silence was not absence but presence.

He knew this. He had always known this.

*But he died with your words on his lips, and his words on yours, and neither of you was heard.*

The triage station continued around him. Another body carried in. The surgeons moved.

Kael adjusted his robes. The silver embroidery caught the light — the sigils of binding, the sigils of truth, the geometry of faith stitched into fabric.

*This is Tyr's will.*

The trained response. The mechanism that converted grief into acceptance. He tested it. The key turned. The lock opened.

Behind it was the boy. The bellows-breathing. The hand that gripped and released. The word — *mum* — formed while Kael's prayer filled the air above it like smoke, present and useless.

He closed the door.

Kael moved on.

---

He returned to the Cathedral at dusk.

The walk through the Emberheart was different tonight. The same streets — wide, black stone, the statues of fallen commanders. The same sounds — the distant percussion of the bombardment, fainter now. But the light was wrong. The amber of the forge-haze had thickened, and the sunset behind the smoke turned the sky a colour that Kael's vocabulary did not serve — not red, not orange, the colour of a bruise seen through glass.

He walked among the soldiers and they parted. The black robes carried their weight.

He climbed the steps.

The nave opened before him — a hundred feet of black marble and iron, the prayer alcoves dark, the kneeling benches empty. The Bell of Penance hung in its cradle, silent. Old Sister Reva was in the Shrine of the Martyrs — the soft, rhythmic sound of cloth on metal, polishing the silver plaques. The sound was constant. It did not change for sieges.

He walked to his alcove. The seventh. *The scales weigh all things. The faithful do not place their thumb upon them.*

He knelt.

The floor received him. Cold. The marble that held its chill like the dead held their secrets.

*Tyr, Lord of Judgment.*

*Eight men died today with my words upon them. Seven received the Last Passing. One spoke the Soldier's Invocation while I spoke the Rite, and the two prayers met in the air between us and neither of them reached thee.*

He stopped.

That was not part of any prayer. That was a statement of fact directed at a god.

*Confession.*

The curriculum provided for this — the acknowledgment of doubt, the naming of the thing that pressed against the foundation, the act of placing it on the Scales.

*I confess that the Rite felt hollow today. I confess that a boy died with his mother's name in his mouth and my prayer in his ears and the two sounds occupied the same air and neither of them changed the outcome.*

The silence.

*I do not doubt thee. I confess the thoughts and I place them on the Scales and I trust that the Scales are not altered by the weight of one man's uncertainty.*

He breathed.

*But the boy was fifteen. And the soldier held the wall. And the prayer did not save either of them.*

The silence was the same silence that had not troubled him yesterday, when he had knelt on this floor and offered the morning prayer and felt the rightness of his function.

It did not trouble him.

But the ground beneath it had shifted.

He could feel it — not a crack, not a fracture, but the settling of a foundation taking a load it had not been designed for. The boy's hand going slack. The soldier's prayer meeting his own. Both dissolving into air that took everything and gave nothing back.

The faith held. The architecture held. The Rite was intact.

But the ground had shifted.

He knelt in the Cathedral of Tyr's Judgment, in the Inner Ring of a city under siege, and the evening settled around him like a garment he had worn every day of his life and that fit, still, but differently — as if the body inside it had changed shape by a fraction too small to measure and too large to ignore.

Sister Reva's polishing continued.

The Bell of Penance hung silent.

And Kael Veyne knelt on the cold floor and held the silence and did not examine the ground beneath it, because examination was the first step toward finding what lived in the foundation — the hairline along which, under enough weight, under enough dead children, under enough prayers that reached no one, the marble would eventually split.

He was not there yet.

The ground had shifted. That was all.

He closed his eyes. The Cathedral breathed with him.

And the silence answered the way it always answered.

With silence.
