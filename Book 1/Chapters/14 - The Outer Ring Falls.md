# CHAPTER FOURTEEN: THE OUTER RING FALLS

## Day 4 — The Break

---

The eastern bastion's wards died at dawn.

Stoneveil was on the rampart when it happened — not the sudden failure he had expected, the catastrophic collapse that the rune-smiths' projections had described in the clean, numerical language of enchantment depletion. The wards did not fail. They faded. The blue-white lattice that had pulsed across the bastion's face for a century — the dwarven work, the old work, the craft that human rune-smiths maintained by rote without understanding the language — thinned to a film, then a suggestion, then the memory of light on stone that was no longer anything but stone.

He watched it go the way he had watched the Anvil go. Without expression. Without reaction. With the flat, grinding awareness that the thing he was watching was the next entry in a ledger that had been running since before the siege began and would continue running until the ledger's arithmetic produced its final answer.

The bastion was stone. Stone broke.

"Captain."

Veyne was beside him. She had not left the rampart in four days — she had slept in the guard post at the base of the stairs, two hours at a time, her slate balanced on her chest the way another woman might have balanced a child. She was thinner. The armour sat differently — the breastplate that had been fitted to a woman who ate three meals a day now accommodated a woman who ate salt meat from a cloth she kept in her pocket and counted the chewing as time wasted.

"The eastern wards are spent, sir. Rune-smith Aldren confirms total depletion. The bastion is unenchanted."

"The gate?"

"Forty-one per cent. Maybe thirty-six — the night bombardment accelerated the drain. Aldren says two days. Maybe less."

Two days on the gate. After that, the Sundered Gate was iron. Iron that had stood for a century behind the enchantment that made it more than iron, and without the enchantment it was what all materials were under siege: a question of how much force, applied for how long, before the answer arrived.

"Redeploy the Ironborn to the eastern bastion. Double section. I want the best men on the stone that no longer has wards to protect it."

"That pulls from—"

"I know what it pulls from."

The words came out harder than he intended. Not louder — Stoneveil did not raise his voice, the same way the wall did not raise itself; both held at the height they were built to and let the pressure do what it would. But harder. The consonants clipped to points. The fatigue was in the edges now, sharpening things that discipline usually smoothed.

Three nights without sleep. He had lost count of the hours — the calculation that had been precise on Day 3, the fifty hours he had tracked and filed and assessed, had become imprecise because the machinery that performed the calculation was the same machinery that the sleeplessness was degrading. He was functional. The decisions were correct. The blade was still cutting. But the resistance was there — the fraction of additional force required to achieve the same result, the roughness in the mechanism that said the tolerances were being exceeded.

He pressed his left hand against the parapet. The tremor was absorbed by the stone.

"Do it, Captain."

Veyne wrote. The stylus moved. The ledger updated.

---

The western wall broke at the second bell.

Not the stone. The ground.

The sound came first — a deep, grinding crack that travelled through the wall's foundation like a bone snapping inside a body, the kind of sound that arrived through the feet and climbed the spine before the ears registered it. Stoneveil felt it in the parapet. Felt the stone shift — not much, a fraction of an inch, the minute settling that preceded the catastrophic — and his hand was on the crenellation and his weight was forward and the word was already in his mouth.

"Western wall."

Then the ground opened.

The goblin charges — whatever Skrixx Blazebinder had packed into the shafts beneath the foundation — detonated in sequence. Three blasts. The first buckled the wall's base at the subsidence point, the section he had identified on Day 1, the pale mortar with the horizontal grain that he had pressed his thumb into and felt give. The second blast widened the fracture. The third brought down a thirty-foot section of the Iron Marches in a cascade of stone and dust and the screaming of the men who had been standing on it.

The wall fell outward. The stones tumbled into the kill zone — the cleared ground, the stakes, the caltrops — and the dust rose in a column that blotted out the western approach, and from inside the dust, through the gap where the wall had been, Stoneveil heard the sound he had been waiting for since Day 1.

The war-horn.

Not the orc war-cry — that was a sound of the body, the voice, the collective rage of warriors charging. The war-horn was older. Deeper. The sound of the instrument the Ironclaw had carried since Stonehaven, the bone-and-iron thing that meant the Warlord had committed his reserves and the assault was no longer probing, no longer testing, no longer the patient, grinding erosion that Day 3 had embodied.

This was the push.

"Western breach — status." His voice was level. The voice was always level. The voice was the last mechanism that discipline controlled, and the mechanism was functioning, and the function was all the men on the wall needed to hear.

A runner arrived. Not the boy — a different runner, older, a Legionnaire whose face was white with dust from the collapse and whose voice carried the specific, compressed quality of a man who was delivering information while his body was still processing the fact that the ground beneath his feet had become a weapon.

"Thirty feet of wall down, sir. The subsidence section. Sergeant Dorran's listening posts were right — the sappers came from below. The charges—" He swallowed. "The charges killed the listening teams. Both posts. Eight men."

Eight men. The men he had placed there because the silence from below was louder than the fighting above. The men who had heard the sappers coming and had not had time to do anything with the hearing before the hearing became irrelevant.

Filed. Eight from seven hundred and seventy left seven hundred and sixty-two. But that number was already wrong — the night's casualties, the wounded who had died on the triage pallets, the men on the western wall who had gone down with the stone. The real number was lower. Stoneveil could feel it the way he felt the tremor in his left hand — not as a calculation but as a weight, the ledger updating itself in the space behind his ribs where the mathematics lived.

"Who's holding the breach?"

"Sergeant Dorran is pulling Legionnaires from the adjacent sections. The western reserve —" The runner's face changed. The dust on it cracked along the lines of an expression that was trying to deliver a fact the expression did not want to carry. "The western reserve was positioned behind the wall, sir. Behind the section that fell."

Behind the section that fell.

Stoneveil processed this. The reserve — thirty men, Legionnaires, positioned in the staging area directly behind the subsidence point because that was where the tactical doctrine placed them, behind the wall they were meant to reinforce if the wall was breached. The wall had not been breached. The wall had been removed. And the thirty men behind it had been standing in the path of several thousand pounds of falling stone.

"Survivors?"

"Unknown, sir. The rubble—"

"Move on. The eastern wall."

---

The eastern assault hit twelve minutes after the western breach.

Stoneveil knew this because the coordination told him what he needed to know about the enemy commander — the same thing the bombardment patterns had told him on Day 1, the same thing the probing attacks had told him on Day 3. The orc Warlord was not a fool. He had waited for the sappers. He had timed the assault to coincide with the collapse. He had held his eastern force until the defenders' attention was pulled west, and then he had thrown them at the bastion that no longer had wards.

The scaling ladders hit the eastern wall at four points simultaneously. Not the probing — the full commitment. Ironclaw heavy infantry, the warriors with the tooth-and-bone insignia, the warbands from Stonehaven. They hit the unprotected bastion with the focused, driving force of men who knew the enchantment was gone and the stone was just stone and the men on the stone were tired and thin and had been grinding for three days without enough sleep or enough food or enough of anything except the particular, stubborn refusal to fall that was the only resource the garrison had in surplus.

The Ironborn met them. The double section Stoneveil had deployed at dawn — the redeployment he had ordered twenty minutes before the wards failed, the redeployment that had pulled men from the gate rotation and thinned the reserve and created gaps that the doctrine said should not exist — held the bastion's parapet in the close, grinding, intimate violence that wall fighting always was.

But the bastion was not the problem.

The problem was the wall on either side of it. The Legionnaires on the adjacent sections — competent, trained, reliable in the institutional way — held their positions against the secondary ladders. But the ladders kept coming. Two. Four. Seven. The orc commander was spending ladders the way Stoneveil spent men — continuously, in volume, accepting the loss of each one as the cost of the next, because the next one might be the one that established the foothold that the defenders could not contain.

Stoneveil watched from the gate rampart. The same position. The same view. The gate between the two bastions, the approaches, the wall curving away east and west. He could see both fronts — the dust column from the western breach and the fighting on the eastern parapet — and the sight was the thing he had known was coming since Day 1, the thing the mathematics had predicted, the thing that the ledger's arithmetic had been calculating toward with the slow, grinding inevitability of a countdown that did not care whether the man doing the counting was ready for the answer.

Both flanks. Simultaneously.

The gate between them.

And the numbers — the numbers that had been wrong since Blackthorn's dispatch, the numbers that had been wrong since the first scout report six months ago — were producing the answer.

"Captain. The outer ring cannot hold both flanks."

Veyne looked at him. The flat, tempered expression — the face that had been as constant as the wall itself for four days — shifted. Not much. A fractional adjustment, the kind of change that happened in the muscles around the eyes when the mind behind them arrived at a conclusion it had been approaching for days and found the conclusion waiting with the patience of something that had always known it would be reached.

"Recommendation, sir?"

She was giving him the word. The professional courtesy — the space in which the commander said the thing that the captain could not say, because saying it was the commander's function and the function was what separated the man who gave the order from the men who carried it.

"Retreat to the Anvil District. The middle ring."

The words arrived with the mechanical precision of an order that had been composed in advance. Not today — not in the twenty minutes since the western wall collapsed. Stoneveil had composed this order on Day 1, standing at the parapet, watching the smoke on the ridge. He had composed it at Ashgate, where the retreat from the forward positions had been the decision that saved four hundred and twenty lives. He had composed it in the locked room behind his ribs where the contingencies lived alongside the forty-three and the seven hundred and seventy and the things he did not think about until the things required thinking about.

"Sir." Veyne's stylus was poised. Not writing — waiting. The pause before the stylus moved was the pause in which the captain confirmed that the order was the order, and the order was confirmed not by repetition but by the details that followed. The details were what made a retreat survivable or catastrophic. "Parameters?"

"Withdraw by section. Eastern wall first — the Ironborn pull back through the gate tunnel, Legionnaires fall back through the secondary access points along the southern wall. Western survivors withdraw through the Anvil Gate — if it's still passable. If not, the service tunnels beneath the Anvil District."

"Timing?"

"Now. Every minute we hold the outer ring costs men we cannot replace. The middle ring's defenses are intact. The Anvil District walls are—" He stopped. The words that had been coming — *sound, defensible, adequate* — were the correct tactical assessment and they were also a lie, because the Anvil District walls were the walls of the district he had firebombed, and the buildings behind those walls were the burned-out shells of the forge-shops and the smithies and the apartments where the workers had slept in shifts, and the command post he would establish in the middle ring would be the ruin of the Black Anvil, and the ruin of the Black Anvil was the place where Drelgar Blackhand had raised his hammer for the last time, and Stoneveil had watched, and the forty-three were there, and the forty-three were always there.

"The Anvil District walls provide adequate defensive positions. The narrower ring reduces our coverage requirement. We can hold the middle ring with the forces we have."

The words were correct. The assessment was correct. The order was correct.

"The wounded."

Veyne said it without inflection. The same flat delivery she applied to every piece of information, the blade that cut without apology. But the blade this time was not aimed at a number. It was aimed at the space between the order and its cost.

"The triage stations in the outer ring — the converted smithy behind the south wall. Twenty-seven men on pallets. The surgeons report fourteen ambulatory. Thirteen cannot be moved."

Thirteen men who could not be moved.

Stoneveil knew what this meant. The knowledge had the same shape as the triage decision on Day 3 — the four terminal cases, the reallocation of surgical supplies. The same line. The same razor-thin margin between the decision and its consequence, between the order and the outcome, between the lives that the retreat would save and the lives that the retreat would leave behind.

Thirteen men. On pallets. In a building that would be behind enemy lines within the hour.

"Time to prepare stretchers?"

"Thirty minutes. Maybe forty. The stretcher-bearers—"

"We don't have thirty minutes."

The sentence landed between them like a stone dropped into still water. The ripples spread. Veyne's face — the flat, tempered, burnished surface that had held for four days — did not change. That was worse than if it had. A face that changed was a face that was processing. A face that did not change was a face that had already processed and had arrived at the same answer and was waiting for the man with the authority to say it aloud.

Stoneveil did not say it aloud.

He did not need to. The order — *retreat to the Anvil District* — carried the implication the way a blade carried its edge. The retreat would move the ambulatory. The retreat would move the fighters. The retreat would not move the thirteen men who could not walk and could not be carried in the time the retreat allowed, because the time the retreat allowed was measured in the minutes between now and the moment the orc assault rolled through the outer ring and turned the triage station into what triage stations became when the enemy arrived: a room full of men who could not fight and could not flee and whose survival depended on the mercy of warriors who had spent three days bleeding against a wall that the men on those pallets had been carried from.

He had given the order.

It was the correct order.

"Withdraw all ambulatory wounded. The surgeons go with them. Medical supplies — everything that can be carried in one trip."

"And the thirteen?"

"Leave a medic. Volunteers only. Anyone who stays, stays understanding that the outer ring will be behind enemy lines before the bell."

Veyne wrote. The stylus moved. The ledger updated.

Stoneveil watched her write and felt the number — thirteen — settle into the space behind his ribs where the others lived. Not beside the forty-three. The forty-three had their own room, their own locked door, their own specific weight. The thirteen went into the operational ledger, the one that tracked the cost of correct decisions, the one that balanced the lives saved against the lives spent and produced the answer that the commander carried because carrying it was the job.

He did not look toward the triage station.

That was not the rule. The rule was *you watch what you order*. But the rule applied to the things he ordered done. The thirteen were not a thing he ordered done. They were a thing he ordered *not done* — the absence of a rescue, the negative space in the retreat, the men left in the gap between what was possible and what was necessary.

The distinction was invisible. The distinction was everything.

---

The retreat began.

It was not elegant. Retreats never were — the doctrine described orderly withdrawals, controlled disengagement, the disciplined movement of forces from one defensive line to another while maintaining cohesion and covering fire. The doctrine was written by men who retreated on paper.

Paper did not have orcs pouring through a thirty-foot breach on the western wall.

The eastern sections moved first. The Ironborn — the double section on the bastion, the veterans who had held the unenchanted stone against four simultaneous ladder assaults — pulled back through the gate tunnel in good order. Stoneveil watched them come through. They moved the way Ironborn always moved — steady, disciplined, their shields still raised, their formation still intact, the muscle memory of a hundred drills converting the chaos of retreat into the practiced geometry of a fighting withdrawal.

The Legionnaires on the adjacent sections were less precise. They came through the secondary access points in groups of four and six, some carrying wounded, some carrying nothing, some carrying the expression that men wore when the ground they had defended for four days was given to the enemy and the giving was not their choice but their commander's. Some of them looked at Stoneveil as they passed through the gate tunnel. He did not look away.

The western flank was the problem.

Sergeant Dorran — competent, dependable, the kind of non-commissioned officer who performed at his ceiling every day and whose ceiling was higher than most men's — had rallied what remained of the western sections around the flanks of the breach. Not holding it — the breach was too wide, the rubble too unstable, the orc warriors already pouring through in numbers that a sergeant and forty Legionnaires could not contain. He was fighting a delay. Buying the minutes the retreat required by spending the men the retreat was meant to save.

The runners brought the reports in fragments. Dorran's line was bending. The western reserve — what remained of it, the men who had survived the wall's collapse — had been absorbed into the delay force. The Anvil Gate, the secondary entrance between the outer ring and the middle ring, was passable. Dorran was pulling his men back toward it in the controlled, section-by-section withdrawal that the doctrine described and reality was shredding.

"Dorran's force is at thirty-one effective, sir. Down from forty-six at the breach."

Fifteen men in twelve minutes. The rate was unsustainable. The rate had been unsustainable since the wall came down, and the wall had come down because the sappers had dug beneath it while the listening posts listened and the engineers sealed and the calculations ran and the outcome was the outcome regardless of the calculations because the enemy's mathematics were better.

Not better. Different. The goblins dug the way goblins dug — fast, chaotic, without regard for what they consumed — and the consumption had included the wall that Stoneveil had inspected on Day 1 and the men who had been standing on it and the reserve who had been standing behind it and the western flank that had been quiet for three days because quiet was not peace but preparation.

"Tell Dorran to break contact. Get his people through the Anvil Gate. If he can't disengage cleanly, he fights through. No more delay actions. The cost exceeds the value."

The runner went. Stoneveil stood on the rampart and watched the western dust column — thicker now, darker, the colour of stone ground to powder by the boots of warriors flooding through the gap — and calculated the time remaining. The Anvil Gate was four hundred paces from the breach. Dorran's force, fighting while retreating, moving backward through streets they knew against an enemy that did not know the streets but did not need to because the enemy had numbers and numbers were their own geography.

Ten minutes. Fifteen if Dorran was good, and Dorran was good, and *good* was the thing that might keep thirty-one men alive long enough to reach a gate that led to a district that had already been destroyed once and was about to become the last thing between the horde and the city's heart.

---

The Sundered Gate held.

Stoneveil descended the rampart for the last time as the final sections withdrew through the tunnel. The rune-wards pulsed — faint, the remaining forty per cent of the enchantment giving the iron a pale, sickly glow that was less protection than memory. The gate had not been breached. The gate had not been tested — not today, not with the full commitment that the flanking assaults represented. The orc Warlord had gone around the gate.

Because the orc Warlord was not a fool.

The gate held. The flanks fell. The result was the same — the outer ring lost, the defenders pushed back, the three-ring city shrinking to two rings, the geography of defense contracting the way all geographies contracted under siege: toward the centre, toward the last wall, toward the place where the final stand would be made because there was no further place to retreat to.

Stoneveil walked through the gate tunnel. The stone overhead was three feet thick — dwarven construction, the same black rock as the bastions, the same old work that had outlasted the enchantments and the rune-smiths and the understanding of the men who maintained it. His boots echoed. The sound was different from the sound on the ramparts — enclosed, contained, the acoustics of a passage that had been designed to funnel defenders in and attackers out, and the irony of walking through it in the wrong direction was a thing he noted and filed and did not examine.

On the other side of the tunnel, the Anvil District waited.

He emerged into the middle ring's northern edge. The air was different — heavier, the smoke from the outer ring's fires mixing with the permanent forge-haze of the Anvil to produce a miasma that sat in the lungs like a weight. The light was amber. The light had been amber since Day 1 and would stay amber until the smoke cleared, and the smoke would not clear.

The defenders were assembling. The sections that had withdrawn through the gate tunnel and the secondary access points were forming up in the broad plaza that fronted the Anvil District's northern wall — the inner wall, the second ring, the line that was now the outer line. Stoneveil could see the faces as he walked through them. The expressions were uniform in the way that trauma produced uniformity — the same blank, compressed, exhausted features repeated across hundreds of faces that had been individual four days ago and were now variations on a single theme: *alive, still alive, not sure for how long.*

He did not stop. He did not speak. He walked through the assembling sections toward the building that intelligence had identified as the strongest defensive position in the Anvil District — the building that sat at the centre of the district like a fist of iron and stone, its chimney stacks blackened and broken, its walls still standing because they were three feet thick and dwarven-built and had survived the firebombing because they were designed to survive everything.

The Black Anvil.

Drelgar Blackhand's forge.

Stoneveil walked toward it. The building resolved through the haze — squat, heavy, the old dwarven style, the same silhouette he had watched burn six months ago from the wall above Forge Road. The chimney stacks were collapsed. The roof was partially caved — the section near the central stack that had folded inward during the fire, the gap through which he had seen the Forge-King raise his hammer for the last time. The walls were scorched. The alchemist's pitch that had clung to the stone had left dark, weeping stains that ran from the roofline to the foundation like tears on a face that had been turned to stone.

He stopped in the entrance.

The door was gone — burned away, the iron hinges twisted and warped by heat that had exceeded their design. The threshold was ash and charred timber and the faint, persistent smell of something that had burned six months ago and would not stop smelling like burning because the stone had absorbed it the way stone absorbed everything: slowly, permanently, without the option of letting go.

Inside, the forge-hall was a ruin. The great anvil was still there — the central piece, the dwarven-made block of iron and steel that had been the heart of Blackhand's work for forty years. It was blackened. The steel face was warped — the thermal shock that had cracked the crucible had deformed the striking surface into something that was no longer flat, no longer true, no longer capable of producing the ring that Edric Thane had fallen asleep to in the rooms above.

The rooms above were gone. The upper floors had collapsed during the fire. The staircase was rubble. The apartments where the forge workers had slept in shifts — the cramped rooms, the shared beds, the lives stacked on top of each other like the bodies in the Veil's Throat — were ash and broken timber and the memory of a number that sat behind Stoneveil's ribs in its locked room.

He walked to the anvil.

The forge-hall was large — high-ceilinged, even with the partial collapse, the dwarven architecture designed to accommodate the heat and fumes of industrial metalwork. It was, from a tactical perspective, an excellent command post. Central location. Thick walls. Defensible entrance. Line of sight to the northern approach through the gap in the roof. Good ground.

He put his hand on the anvil.

Cold.

The metal had not been warm in six months. The forge beneath it — the great hearth that had burned for sixty years, the fire that had never gone out until Stoneveil's incendiaries had fed it until it consumed itself — was dark. Ash. The crucible was cracked, the iron bowl split along a fracture line that ran from the rim to the base, the molten slag long since cooled into a solid mass of grey-black metal that filled the bowl like a wound that had healed wrong.

He stood in the exact spot where Drelgar Blackhand had stood.

He knew this because he had watched. He had stood on the wall and watched the Forge-King raise his hammer, and the hammer had fallen on this anvil, on this spot, in the last minutes of a life that ended because Stoneveil had ordered it to end. The silhouette had been here. The broad figure. The hammer rising and falling. The work being finished.

The forty-three arrived.

He did not invite them. They came the way they always came — through the locked door, past the discipline, past the filing system that kept them separate from the operational numbers, past the wall he had built between the things he did and the things the things he did had cost. They came because he was standing in the place where the cost had been measured, and the place did not permit the door to remain closed.

Forty-three. Under sixteen. The number in the smaller font, in the column without a heading. Apprentices. Children of forge workers. The noncombatants who had taken shelter in the lower chambers when the incendiaries hit the ventilation channels and the molten slag erupted through the floor grates. They had not screamed with words. The children below had made a different sound — the sound that came from below where no words lived, the sound that Stoneveil had catalogued and filed and carried in the locked room for six months and was now standing in the room where the sound had been made.

He did not move.

His hand was on the anvil. The cold iron beneath his palm. The warped surface, the deformed face, the steel that had been true and was no longer true. His left hand. The one that trembled.

The tremor was there. Against the anvil, the vibration transferred from his fingers into the metal, and the metal received it the way it received everything — cold, permanent, without the option of giving it back.

"Warden."

Veyne. Behind him. The measured stride, the sound he knew.

"The sections are assembling. Dorran's force made it through the Anvil Gate — twenty-three of thirty-one. The gate is being sealed behind them. The outer ring is—" She paused. Selected the word. "Lost."

Lost. The outer ring. The Iron Marches. The Sundered Gate. The wall he had walked for twenty years, the wall he had measured and patched and reinforced and inspected every stone of, the wall that had been his and was now the enemy's and would be held by warriors who did not know the angles or the dead spots or the places where the mortar had thinned, and the not-knowing would not matter because the wall was on their side now and walls did not care who stood on them.

"Effective strength."

Veyne consulted the slate. The stylus was still. The numbers were already written.

"Five hundred and twelve combat-effective. Forty-one wounded, ambulatory. Twenty-three from Dorran's force, of which nine are wounded. The war-mages — eleven active. Four lost in the eastern bastion fighting."

Five hundred and twelve.

Three hundred and thirty-eight fewer than they had started with. Three hundred and thirty-eight men and women who had been alive on Day 1 and were not alive on Day 4, their deaths recorded on Veyne's slate in the column that tracked the cost without distinguishing between the ones who died on the wall and the ones who died because the wall fell on them and the ones who died because a commander decided that the retreat could not wait for stretchers.

Thirteen. In the triage station. Behind the line.

Stoneveil removed his hand from the anvil.

"Establish the command post here. Clear the rubble from the forge-hall. I want defensive positions on the northern approach — barricades across the Anvil's main streets. Use the ruins. Use whatever the firebombing left."

His voice was level. The mechanism was functioning. The decisions were arriving with the same precision they had arrived with on Day 1, and Day 2, and Day 3, and the precision was not diminished by the tremor in his left hand or the number in the locked room or the cold iron of an anvil that had absorbed the vibration of a man whose body was telling him things his mind would not permit.

"The ruins provide good material, sir. The collapsed buildings—"

"I know what the collapsed buildings provide, Captain."

Veyne closed her mouth. Opened it again.

"Yes, sir."

She turned to go. Stopped.

"Sir. The thirteen."

The number. The number he had not said aloud. The number that Veyne had written on her slate and he had filed in the operational ledger and neither of them had addressed because addressing it would not change it and not changing it was the point — the point of the decision, the point of the retreat, the point of the arithmetic that produced correct answers at the cost of men who could not be moved.

"The volunteer medic?"

"Surgeon's apprentice. A boy named Aldren. Not the rune-smith — a different Aldren. Eighteen."

Eighteen. The age of the runner in the Prologue. The age of boys who volunteered for things because they had not yet learned that volunteering was a form of currency, and the currency was spent in places where the exchange rate was life.

"Note it."

"Sir."

Veyne left. Her boots on the stone floor — the same sound, measured, efficient, the stride that did not change because changing it would mean something, and meaning was a resource that Isolde Veyne spent only where it altered the outcome.

Stoneveil stood in Drelgar Blackhand's forge.

The light came through the collapsed roof — amber, wrong, the filtered haze of a city that was eating itself ring by ring. The anvil sat in the light. The warped face. The cold iron. The memory of a hammer rising and falling and a man who had finished his work because that was what smiths did, even when the fire was coming, even when the walls were falling, even when the man who had ordered the fire was watching from the wall above.

He looked at his hands.

The right hand — the sword hand — was steady. The grip he had maintained for three days had released sometime during the retreat, the fingers unlocking from the leather with the stiff, reluctant separation of a man letting go of the thing that had kept him functional. The callus between his thumb and forefinger was raw, the skin broken, the blister that had formed beneath the callus wept a thin, clear fluid that caught the light.

The left hand trembled.

He placed both hands on the anvil. The right hand, steady. The left hand, trembling. Both on the cold iron, both on the surface where Blackhand's hammer had fallen, both in the exact place where the work had been done and the work had been ended and the ending was Stoneveil's order and the order was correct and the correctness was the worst thing about it.

The same way the retreat was correct. The same way the thirteen were correct. The same way every decision he had made since Day 1 was correct, and every correct decision had killed someone, and the killing was the job, and the job was the wall, and the wall was now a burned-out forge in a district he had destroyed, and the forge was cold, and the anvil was warped, and the tremor in his left hand was the only part of him that was still telling the truth.

He stood there for a long time.

Then he removed his hands from the anvil, and turned to the entrance, and began giving the orders that the next phase of the siege required. Barricade positions. Supply redistribution. Rotation schedules for a garrison that was now five hundred and twelve, defending a perimeter that was smaller but no less lethal, in a district whose ruins were his walls and whose ghosts were his company.

The orders came easily.

They always did.
