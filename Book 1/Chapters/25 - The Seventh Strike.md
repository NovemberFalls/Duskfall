# Chapter 25 — THE SEVENTH STRIKE

## Day 6 — The Gate

---

He heard the barricade blow before he saw it.

The detonation rolled through the Anvil District like something geological — not the sharp crack of goblin engine-fire but the deep, structural percussion of a foundation being ripped out from under the weight it carried. Stoneveil felt it through his boots. Through the cobblestones. Through the anvil his left hand was pressed against, the iron conducting the vibration from the ground through the warped striking surface and into his palm and up his arm and into the place behind his ribs where the arithmetic lived.

The secondary barricade. Dorran's barricade. The one the sergeant had built correctly, without flourish, every stone fitted to the stone beside it.

Gone.

He did not wait for the report. He was moving before the dust column rose above the northern rooftops — out of the forge, through the entrance, into the street where the smoke had thickened to the consistency of dusk and the light was the same grey-orange bruise that had been hanging over the district since Day 4. The sound of the blast was still settling, the echoes rolling between the ruined buildings, when the first runner appeared.

The boy was twelve. Maybe thirteen. Running south on Forge Road with the particular, desperate gait of a child whose legs had been asked to carry a message faster than the message wanted to travel. His face was grey with dust. His eyes were the size of the message.

"The barricade, Warden — Skrixx's charges — the avenue is open—"

"I know." Stoneveil was already past him. Already processing. The charges Dorran had reported — three positions, goblin compound packed against the foundation, chemical fusing that couldn't be disarmed. The clock he had known was ticking. The clock that had stopped.

Veyne fell in beside him. She had been somewhere behind him — her post, the observation point, one of the dozen places the Captain occupied in a given hour because the Captain occupied whatever position the next report required and the reports came from everywhere. Her slate was in her hands. The chalk was almost gone.

"Casualty reports coming in. The blast took the centre section. Position Three is collapsed — the chimney came down. Northern barricade overrun."

"The dormitory wall?"

"Holding. Tesswin's people fell back there. Fragments from the secondary — five, maybe six, fighting withdrawal down the avenue."

Five or six. From the thirteen who had held the secondary barricade. From the thirty it was designed for. From the eight hundred and fifty who had stood on the walls six days ago when the mathematics had been difficult instead of impossible.

"The enemy."

"Through the breach and advancing south. Full commitment — scouts report every warband in the avenue. This is the push, Warden."

The push. The final push. The spending of everything because the spending was the only way to end it and the ending was coming regardless of whether it was spent. Stoneveil had known it would come today. Had known it since dawn, since the night assault, since the count on the slate that said three hundred and forty-seven and the three hundred and forty-seven was the number that said today because tomorrow required a number that tomorrow would not have.

He moved south. Past the forge. Past the position where Dorran's engineers were already responding — pulling timber from the secondary buildings, dragging rubble into the avenue, the instinct of soldiers who built walls the way other men breathed: automatically, compulsively, the response to destruction that was more destruction's opposite. But the building was futile now. There was nothing to build between the breach and the gate. Nothing except the dormitory wall, and the dormitory wall was a suggestion.

Then we hold this one, he had told Dorran.

He reached the southern edge of the Anvil District in seven minutes. The dormitory wall stretched across the avenue — the worker housing, converted to fighting positions, the arrow slits and rubble barricades that his soldiers had built from a district's wreckage. Behind it, the courtyard. Behind the courtyard, the gate to the Inner Ring. The gate that Blackthorn had closed and barred and manned with the Ironbound Guard who would not come.

The fighting was at the dormitory wall.

He could hear it — the compressed, intimate violence of a position being overrun. Not the distant percussion of the wall or the measured rhythm of the barricade fights. This was closer. Tighter. The sound of warriors in hallways and doorways and the spaces between buildings where the geometry compressed everything into the range where size and fury mattered more than formation or discipline.

Stoneveil did not go to the dormitory wall.

He went to the gate.

---

The gate to the Inner Ring was twelve feet of oak reinforced with iron banding, set into a stone archway that had been built in the old dwarven style — thick, functional, designed to withstand the kinds of forces that the first settlers of Emberfall had learned to expect from a continent that was trying to kill everything on it. The gate was closed. The gate had been closed since Day 4, when Blackthorn's order had come down and the order had been clear and the clarity had been the cruelty.

Two Ironbound Guard flanked the gate from the other side. Stoneveil could see the tips of their halberds above the wall's edge — the polished steel catching what light the smoke permitted, the weapons immaculate, unused, the armament of soldiers who had stood behind a gate for six days while the men and women on the other side of it bled and burned and died within earshot.

He did not look at the halberds.

He looked at the courtyard.

Fifty paces of open ground. Cobblestones. The remains of a market — stalls dismantled for barricade material, the dry fountain at the centre, the open space that had been designed for commerce and had become a killing ground through the same process that turned everything in the Anvil into something it had not been designed for. The courtyard was the last space. Behind him, the gate. Ahead, the dormitory wall. Between them, the ground where the siege would end.

Stoneveil stood in the courtyard. Between the gate and the wall. Between the thing he was defending and the thing that was falling.

His sword was in his right hand. The blade that had been with him at Ashgate, the blade that had killed Overseer Brok Drakhold in the pass, the blade that had been reforged twice because the steel remembered what it had done and the remembering wore grooves in the edge that no whetstone could remove. The blade was notched. Scored. The flat was dark with residue that was not rust but was the colour of rust because the things that left residue on sword blades were always the colour of rust.

His left hand was empty. The shield he had carried at Ashgate had broken on Day 4. He had not replaced it. There were shields — there were always shields, the dead provided them in quantities the living could not exhaust — but Stoneveil had not picked one up because the picking up required a left hand that was steady and the left hand had not been steady since Day 3 and the unsteadiness was not a problem he could solve with a shield.

He pressed the left hand against his thigh. The tremor was there. It was always there. He let it be.

Veyne appeared. "Warden. You should be at the command post."

"This is the command post now, Captain."

She looked at him. At the gate behind him. At the courtyard — the killing ground, the open space, the fifty paces of cobblestone between the gate and the dying. She understood. The understanding arrived in the same way her reports arrived: completely, without the unnecessary step of explanation.

"The dormitory wall won't hold," she said.

"No."

"The enemy will be through within the hour."

"Sooner."

"Then the courtyard—"

"Then the courtyard."

She held the slate against her chest. The chalk was a stub now — an inch of compressed calcium, the last inch, the kind of inch that could record three more numbers or five more words before it became a smear and the recording stopped.

"What do I report, Warden?"

"You don't. The last report has been sent. There is nothing to add."

"Stoneveil."

His name. Not his title. She had not used his name since Ashgate, since the pass, since the night when four hundred and twenty survivors had sat in the dark and listened to the orcs retreat and the retreating had been a sound so beautiful that Stoneveil had sat down for the first time in three days and Veyne had sat beside him and neither of them had spoken and the not-speaking had been the only celebration either of them could afford.

He looked at her. The woman who had carried the count. Who had not changed. Who had stood beside every number as the numbers grew smaller and the growing smaller was a kind of dying and she had recorded each death with the precision of a clerk and the weight of a mourner and the face of a woman who had given away everything the siege could take and had nothing left to give except presence.

"Get the wounded to the gate," he said. "The ones who can't fight. Tell the Ironbound Guard to open — tell them the Warden of the Sundered Gate is ordering the evacuation of non-combatants through the gate to the Inner Ring. If they refuse, tell them Stoneveil said the dead will have their names."

"They'll refuse."

"Then break the side passage. The service corridor beneath the eastern wall. Dorran showed it to me on Day 2. It's sealed but it's not fortified. An axe and five minutes."

Veyne's eyes moved to the eastern wall. The calculation was instant — the same calculation she performed with everything, the measurement of what was possible against what was necessary and the identification of the gap between them and the method of closing it.

"The wounded. The civilians. Through the service corridor."

"Everyone who can't hold a sword. Now, Captain."

She hesitated. The second hesitation. The hesitation that was not hesitation but the body's protest against the order that the mind had already accepted — the order that said *go* when the body wanted to stay, the order that separated the captain from the commander at the point when separation meant one of them would not be standing when the other returned.

"Stoneveil."

"Go."

She went.

He watched her move toward the eastern wall — fast, efficient, the stride of a woman who had been told to save lives and who would save them with the same mechanical precision she had used to count the ones that were lost. She would find Dorran. She would find the corridor. She would break it open and push the wounded through and the pushing would be the last useful thing the mathematics could produce.

Stoneveil turned back to the courtyard.

The dormitory wall was falling. He could hear it — the sounds changing, the rhythm shifting from defense to collapse, the specific frequency that said the wall was no longer a structure but a sequence of individual deaths. Tesswin's people. The fragments. The last of the garrison, spending themselves in doorways and stairwells and the compressed spaces where a single soldier could hold a corridor for sixty seconds and sixty seconds was all the corridor was worth.

He stood at the gate.

He waited.

---

The dormitory wall broke at the eleventh bell.

The orcs came through in a ragged wave — not the disciplined formations of the first days, not the coordinated war-lines that had marched from Bloodtide Bay. They came the way an army came when it had been fighting for six days and the fighting had ground away the formations and the discipline and left only the momentum, the raw forward pressure of warriors who had been pushing against a wall for a week and had felt the wall give and were pouring through the giving with everything they had left.

They spilled into the courtyard. Twenty. Thirty. The dark shapes of armoured bodies emerging from the dormitory wall's ruins, from the gaps between buildings, from the alleys on either side where the defense had crumbled, the warriors fanning out across the cobblestones with weapons drawn and war-cries that had been war-cries six days ago and were now the hoarse, damaged sounds of throats that had been shouting for too long.

Behind them — behind all of them — one shape larger than the rest.

Stoneveil saw him.

The Warlord.

He was everything the intelligence reports had described and nothing the intelligence reports had captured. The boar-tusk pauldrons. The iron plates. The war-axe in his right hand and the tower shield on his left arm and the skull hanging from his belt — the old Warlord's skull, the chain, the weight of command made visible and literal in the way that orc culture made everything visible and literal. The armour was dented. Scored. Battered by six days of being at the front because the front was where this Warlord stood and the standing was the same standing Stoneveil understood because it was the same standing.

The recognition arrived without thought. The way the recognition had arrived every time Stoneveil had studied the orc commander's movements — through the assault patterns, through the tactical adjustments, through the quality of the decisions that met his own decisions across the distance of a siege with the precision of a conversation. He had been talking to this man for six days. Move and counter-move. Attack and adaptation. The grammar of command, spoken in the language of dead soldiers.

The orc stopped at the courtyard's edge.

He was looking at Stoneveil the way Stoneveil was looking at him — with the assessment, the measurement, the recognition of a man who had been fighting the same fight from the other side of the wall and who understood the weight because the weight was the same weight and the wall was down and the men who had carried the weight on either side were standing in the open ground between the things they had been protecting.

Two men. Two exhausted men. One gate.

The orc warriors had spread across the courtyard. Some moved toward the gate — toward Stoneveil's flanks, toward the stone archway, the instinct of an army that saw the objective and moved toward it. But the Warlord raised his axe — not to strike, to signal — and the movement stopped. The warriors halted. Weapons lowered a fraction. Eyes shifted to the Warlord, waiting.

He was giving them the courtyard.

Not the courtyard — the moment. The space between the two commanders. The ground that orc culture said belonged to the leaders when the leaders met, the ground where the chain was decided, where the skulls were earned, where the fight that mattered happened between the men whose fighting determined what the fighting meant.

Stoneveil understood this. Not because he knew orc culture — he did not, not in its details, not in its rituals. He understood it because command was command and leaders were leaders and the thing that was happening was the thing that happened at the end of every siege he had ever studied, every battle, every campaign: the point where the wall stopped mattering and the men mattered and the men met.

He stepped forward.

His left hand trembled. He let it tremble. The tremor had been telling him something since Day 3 and the something was the same thing the numbers had been telling him and the numbers were three hundred and forty-seven and the forty-three were pressed against the locked door and the door was not a door anymore, the door was a membrane, and the membrane was thin and the thing behind it was pressing and the pressing had been the background noise of the entire siege and he had held it and held it and held it.

He held it now.

He crossed the courtyard. Twenty paces. Thirty. The cobblestones were wet — rain and blood, the surface that every surface in the Anvil had become, the ground that was never stable because stability was a luxury and the Anvil did not trade in luxuries. His boots found purchase. The right leg was solid. The left had stiffened — a wound from Day 4, a cut across the thigh that he had bandaged himself because the surgeons were occupied with men who needed them more and the needing more was not a judgment but a triage decision and triage decisions were the decisions he made best and the best was the worst part.

The Warlord watched him come.

The distance closed.

Twenty paces. Fifteen. Ten.

The orc's eyes were dark. Not the brown that humans called brown — darker, deeper, the colour of earth that had never seen the surface, the colour of things that grew in the places where light was a visitor and not a resident. The eyes tracked Stoneveil with the patience of a predator that had stopped being in a hurry because the hurry was over and the thing that remained was the thing that predators did when the hunt ended and the hunted turned and faced.

Stoneveil raised his sword.

The blade came up in the guard position — the one from Ashgate, the one his instructor had drilled into him thirty years ago, the position that said *I am here and I am ready and the readiness is not fear but preparation.* The position that his body knew the way it knew standing and breathing and the weight of a sword in the hand that held one.

The Warlord raised his axe.

---

The first strike was the orc's.

The war-axe came down in an arc that was not fast and not slow but *heavy* — the descending weight of a weapon that was designed to split things, held by arms that had been splitting things for longer than Stoneveil had been holding a command. The arc was direct. Honest. The stroke of a man who did not feint because feinting was a luxury and the Warlord was not spending luxuries.

Stoneveil stepped left. Not far — a half-step, the distance his stiffened left leg permitted, the compromise between what the movement required and what the body could provide. The axe passed his right shoulder. Close. The displaced air brushed his cheek.

His sword came up in the counter — a thrust, aimed at the gap between the pauldron and the chest plate, the seam where the armour's coverage ended and the body began. The blade found the gap. Found resistance. The point bit into something — leather, flesh, the layers between — and the orc twisted and the blade scraped across the iron and skidded free without depth.

First blood. His. A scratch. The kind of wound that a fresh soldier would not have felt and an exhausted one felt in the bones because the bones had been accumulating every impact for six days and each new impact was added to the sum and the sum was a number that the body could feel even if the mind refused to count it.

The Warlord did not acknowledge the wound. His shield came around — the tower shield, the massive slab of wood and iron that an orc warrior carried the way a human carried a buckler — and the impact caught Stoneveil across the left side and sent him sideways, his boots losing the cobblestones, his balance going and coming back in the ugly, lurching recovery of a body that was finding its footing through stubbornness rather than skill.

**One.**

---

The second strike was Stoneveil's.

He came in low. Under the shield. The sword horizontal, the edge leading, the cut aimed at the Warlord's leading knee — the joint, the hinge, the structural point that held the weight of the body and the armour and the six days of siege that sat on every warrior's frame like a second set of armour, invisible and heavier. If the knee failed, the Warlord fell. If the Warlord fell, the fight ended.

The orc read it. Dropped the shield to cover. The tower shield met the blade with a sound like a gate slamming — iron on iron, the vibration running up the blade and through the grip and into Stoneveil's arm and the arm absorbed it the way the arm absorbed everything, through the accumulated endurance of thirty years of holding things that hit back.

The Warlord's counter came over the shield — the axe head sweeping laterally, a stroke that would have taken Stoneveil's head if Stoneveil's head had been where the stroke expected it to be. It was not. He had ducked — not the trained duck, the practiced evasion. The exhausted duck. The dropping of the knees that happened when the body was too tired for the movement the situation required and substituted a cruder version, the survival instinct's rough draft of the manoeuvre the training had specified.

The axe passed over him. He came up. His sword found the Warlord's right arm — the forearm, above the bracer, the muscle that held the axe. The cut opened the skin. Not deep. Not enough. The Warlord's forearm was corded with the kind of muscle that blades did not cut easily, the dense, structural tissue of a body that had been swinging weapons since childhood, and the blade skidded along the surface the way it had skidded along the armour.

The Warlord grunted. The first sound. The abbreviated acknowledgment of a body receiving damage and filing it and continuing.

**Two.**

---

The third.

They met in the centre of the courtyard. Shield to body. Stoneveil hit the tower shield with his shoulder — not a technique, a collision, the impact of a man who had no shield and was using his body as one because the body was the last thing he had and the last thing was enough when the alternative was backing away from the man who stood between him and the end of the siege.

The collision drove the Warlord back a step. One step. The orc's feet found the cobblestones and held. The weight behind the shield was the weight of a body that was built for collision, the mass and the muscle and the low centre of gravity that orc warriors trained for from the time they could stand, and the collision barely moved him.

But the step opened a line.

Stoneveil's sword came through the gap between the shield's edge and the Warlord's body — the space the step had created, the fraction of distance that the movement had placed between the defence and the defender. The blade found the Warlord's side. Left side. Below the ribs. The cut was fast but shallow — the exhaustion stealing the depth, the arms that had been holding a sword for six days unable to produce the force that a fresh arm would have driven through the armour and into the body behind it.

The Warlord's axe came down on Stoneveil's shoulder.

Not the edge. The haft. The wooden shaft striking the junction of neck and shoulder with the force of a man who was too close for the axe head and was using whatever part of the weapon the range permitted. The impact was not a wound. It was a message — pain that flared through the shoulder and down the arm and into the hand that held the sword and the hand almost opened because the hand was connected to the shoulder and the shoulder had been struck by something that was designed for striking and the design was working.

He held the grip. The callus between thumb and forefinger — the one that had crusted and broken and crusted again — held.

**Three.**

---

The fourth and fifth came in a rush that Stoneveil's mind could not separate into individual exchanges.

The Warlord drove forward. The tower shield became a wall — a moving wall, a battering instrument, the weapon that was not the axe but was equally lethal because a tower shield in the hands of an orc warrior was not a defensive tool but an offensive one, the surface that pushed and crushed and created the space for the axe to fill.

Stoneveil went backward. Two steps. Three. His left leg protested — the wound, the stiffness, the joint that had been holding for six days and was reaching the limit of what holding could do. He parried the axe. Caught the head on his blade. The impact jarred through his wrists and the jarring was familiar because the jarring was what happened when you caught a weapon that was heavier than yours on a blade that was lighter than theirs and the disparity was the kind of disparity that exhaustion magnified until the disparity was a factor and the factor was a number and the number said this could not continue.

He cut. The blade found the Warlord's shield arm — the wrist, above the shield's grip, the exposed joint that the tower shield's width did not cover because the tower shield covered the body and the wrist was the thing that connected the body to the shield and the wrist was narrow and the blade was sharp.

The cut was good.

The Warlord's grip loosened. The tower shield dipped — an inch, two inches, the weight of the wood and iron suddenly unsupported on one side, the hand that held it losing the strength that held it because the tendons above the wrist had been cut and the tendons were the mechanism and the mechanism had been interrupted.

The axe came in compensation. Faster. The Warlord dropping the injured shield arm and swinging the axe two-handed, the shift from shield-and-axe to axe-alone happening in the space between heartbeats because the Warlord was a warrior and warriors adapted and the adaptation was the thing that separated the dead from the dying from the surviving.

The axe caught Stoneveil's left arm.

The edge. Across the upper arm. The cut went through the fabric and through the mail beneath and into the muscle with the particular, specific sensation of a blade entering flesh — not pain, not immediately, but the deep, structural wrongness of a body being opened in a place that was supposed to remain closed.

He felt the blood. Hot. Running inside the sleeve, pooling at the elbow, dripping from the cuff in a rhythm that was too fast for a cut that should have been survivable and was survivable and was going to cost him the arm's function in minutes rather than hours.

**Four. Five.**

---

The sixth was Stoneveil's.

The blood on his left arm had soaked through the sleeve and was dripping steadily, the rate increasing with each heartbeat, the pump working against him now, the body's own system delivering the blood to the opening the orc's axe had made and the opening receiving it and sending it to the cobblestones where it joined the rain and the blood that was already there.

He could not lift the left arm above the shoulder. The muscle had been cut. Not severed — the arm still moved, still responded to the instructions the mind sent, but the responses were delayed and diminished, the signal degraded by the damage, the way a runner's speed degraded when the runner's leg was wounded.

The Warlord was wounded too.

The cut on his side had opened further. The shallow wound from the third strike had deepened as the orc's movements pulled at the torn flesh, the exertion widening what Stoneveil's blade had started, the body's own motion becoming the weapon's ally. Blood darkened the Warlord's leather underlayer on the left side. The wrist wound was worse — the shield had been dropped, the tower shield lying on the cobblestones between them like a fallen wall, and the hand that had held it was clenched in a fist that was holding not from strength but from the refusal to open.

Two wounded men. Two men who had been fighting for six days and who had met each other at the end of it and who were spending the last of what they had on each other because the spending was the duty and the duty was the only thing either of them had left.

Stoneveil attacked.

Not elegantly. Not with the technique that his instructor had spent thirty years drilling into the muscle and the bone and the reflexes that had saved his life at Ashgate and the pass and every engagement since. The technique was gone. The technique had been ground away by the fight the way the siege had ground away the garrison, and what remained was the residue — the core, the thing beneath the training, the raw, animal mechanism that drove a sword toward the body of the man who stood between the swordsman and survival.

He lunged. The right leg drove him forward. The sword extended — point first, the thrust aimed at the Warlord's chest, at the damaged armour, at the dent above the heart where something had hit the iron plate during the siege and the dent was a weak point and the weak point was the only target that mattered because the only target that mattered was the one that ended it.

The Warlord turned. The axe came across. Not to strike — to deflect, the haft meeting the blade and pushing it wide, the parry of a man who had no shield and was using his axe as one. The sword slid past the Warlord's chest. Past the dent. Past the target.

But Stoneveil was inside.

Inside the axe's arc. Inside the Warlord's reach. The distance between them compressed to nothing — chest to chest, the human and the orc, the bodies that had been spending themselves on each other pressed together in the intimate, ugly proximity of two men who had run out of range and were fighting in the space where range did not exist.

Stoneveil drove his pommel into the Warlord's face.

The crossguard and the pommel — the heavy, iron counterweight at the blade's base — struck the orc's jaw. The impact was not elegant. It was the closest thing to a punch that a sword could deliver, the weapon used as a club because the distance was too short for the edge and too close for the point and the body that held the weapon had been reduced to the most primitive version of itself.

The Warlord's head snapped sideways. Blood from the mouth. A tooth, or a piece of a tooth, hitting the cobblestones with a small sound that was lost in the larger sounds of the fight.

The orc staggered. One step. Two.

**Six.**

---

The Warlord did not fall.

Stoneveil had hit men with the pommel before. Armoured men, fresh men, men who were not fighting at the end of their reserves in the ruins of a city that had already killed them both in every way that mattered except the final one. Those men had fallen. The pommel was designed for it — the concentrated force delivered to the face, the skull's response to impact, the reliable, structural failure of consciousness when the brain was shaken inside the bone that held it.

The Warlord did not fall. He staggered. He bled. His jaw was wrong — shifted, the bone displaced by the force, the face that had been symmetrical becoming asymmetrical in the specific, gruesome way that broken jaws became when the breaking was violent and the violence was precise.

But he did not fall.

He set his feet. The cobblestones received his weight. The body that had been built for war and had spent itself in war found its centre — not through balance, not through training, but through the same mechanism that kept Stoneveil standing, the same mechanism that had kept the garrison standing, the same mechanism that held walls up and men up and the world up when the numbers said the holding should have stopped: will. The refusal to be finished before the finishing was done.

The dark eyes found Stoneveil.

The Warlord looked at him. Through the blood and the broken jaw and the wounds and the weight of four hundred dead warriors and the empty pouch where the spirits had been and the children at Bloodtide Bay and the children behind the gate and all the children everywhere who would eat or starve based on what happened in the next moment.

Two men. Standing. Barely.

The Warlord shifted the axe to both hands. The wrist wound leaked through his clenched fingers, the blood making the haft slippery, the grip compromised. He held anyway. The way Stoneveil held. The same grip.

Stoneveil's left arm hung. The blood from the cut had soaked his side, the sleeve heavy with it, the arm a weight rather than a tool. His right arm — the sword arm — ached in a way that was not pain but exhaustion, the deep, cellular fatigue of muscles that had been contracting and releasing for six days and were reaching the boundary between function and failure. The boundary was close. He could feel it the way he felt the tremor — as a condition, as a fact, as the approaching edge of something that could not be postponed but could be held at arm's length for one more minute. One more exchange.

One more.

He raised the sword. The blade was heavy. Heavier than it had been at the first strike, heavier than it had been at Ashgate, heavier than it had been on any day of any campaign in thirty years of holding a weapon. The heaviness was not the blade's weight. It was the weight of everything the blade had been asked to do — the Anvil, the forge, the fire, the Forge-King standing with his hammer raised, the nine hundred, the forty-three, the five hundred and three, the count that had been growing since the first incendiary arced through the smoke and burst on the barricades below.

He raised it anyway.

The Warlord charged.

The last charge. Not the measured advance of the courtyard. Not the careful, assessed approach of two commanders taking each other's measure. The charge — the full-bodied, final commitment of a warrior who had decided that the next moment was the last moment and the last moment belonged to the axe and the axe belonged to the arms and the arms were spending their last.

Stoneveil did not step back.

The blade was waiting.

The axe came. The overhead arc — the killing stroke, the two-handed descent of a weapon aimed at the junction of neck and shoulder where the armour's coverage ended and the killing began. The arc was fast. Faster than the sixth strike, faster than the fifth, the Warlord's last reserves committed to the velocity the way his last warriors had been committed to the push, everything spent at once because spending was all that remained.

Stoneveil stepped into the arc.

Not under it. Not around it. Into it. Into the space between the axe's descent and the body that swung it, the space that existed for a fraction of a second before the arc completed and the blade arrived, the gap that a fresh man would have exploited with technique and an exhausted man exploited with the absence of anything else to try.

The axe head passed his right side. Close. The edge brushed the armour above his hip. He felt it — the scrape, the pressure, the razor line of proximity between the thing that would have killed him and the thing that missed.

His sword came up.

The thrust was not clean. Not precise. Not the textbook execution that his instructor would have recognized, the form perfected in a training yard on a summer afternoon when the body was rested and the mind was clear and the target was a straw mannequin instead of a man. The thrust was the ugly, compressed motion of a body that had one arm, one chance, and the accumulated instinct of thirty years that said *here* — the point, the angle, the target that was the Warlord's throat above the gorget, the exposed column of muscle and tendon and blood that the armour did not cover because the armour covered the torso and the head and the throat was the between, the gap, the compromise.

The blade found it.

The point entered the Warlord's throat on the left side, below the jaw. The resistance was less than he expected — the flesh giving, the blade sliding through the muscle and past the tendon and into the vessel behind it with the specific, terrible ease that a sharp blade had when it found the place it was meant to find.

**Seven.**

---

The Warlord's eyes went wide.

Not with surprise. Not with fear. With the particular expression of a body receiving the information that the body's time was ending, the autonomic response that preceded the conscious recognition, the pupils dilating because the pupils dilated when the blood pressure changed and the blood pressure was changing because the blood was leaving through the hole in the throat and the leaving was the last leaving.

Stoneveil pulled the blade free.

The blood came with it. Dark. Arterial. The pulse visible in the flow — the heart still beating, still working, still performing its function with the mechanical indifference of an organ that did not know it was pumping its last and would continue until the supply ran out and the supply was running out.

The Warlord did not fall.

His feet were set. The cobblestones held them. The body that had been built for war — the body that had carried the chain, the skull, the four hundred dead, the empty pouch, the children's hunger — stood in the courtyard of a city it had failed to take and the standing was not resistance and not defiance. It was the old ways. The demand that a Warlord died standing because standing was the posture of command and command did not end when the body ended.

The axe lowered. Not dropped — lowered, the hands bringing the weapon down in a controlled descent that was the last controlled thing the body would do, the muscles performing their final act of obedience to the will that had been driving them for six days and longer, for thirty years of war, for the entire arc of a life spent standing at the front.

The dark eyes held Stoneveil's.

No words. The jaw was broken. The throat was opened. The voice that had spoken to War-Chiefs and shamans and the spirits that were gone and the children at the shore camps was silent. But the eyes spoke. The eyes said the thing that the voice could not say and the thing was not hatred and not anger and not the last curse of a dying man upon his killer.

The thing was recognition.

The recognition that the man who had killed him was the same man. The other side of the same wall. The other end of the same chain. The leader who would live with the killing the way the Warlord would have lived with his — as a weight, as a cost, as the price that command charged for the privilege of deciding who died and the deciding was the thing that made command a punishment disguised as a title.

The eyes held for three heartbeats. Four.

Then the thing behind them left.

The body remained standing. Five seconds. Six. The feet on the cobblestones, the axe lowered, the armour dented and scored, the skull at the belt with its empty sockets staring south toward the gate that the Warlord had been walking toward for six days and would never reach.

Then the body fell.

Not backward. Forward. The weight tipping in the direction it had been travelling, the body falling toward the gate, toward the thing it had been fighting for, the momentum of the march continuing past the moment when the marching stopped. The armour hit the cobblestones with a sound that was not loud. Not dramatic. The sound of a heavy thing coming to rest. The sound of the end.

Warlord Thokk Ironhide lay on the cobblestones of the courtyard in the Anvil District of Emberfall, facing the gate he had come to take, his axe still in his hands, his blood pooling in the cracks between the stones and mixing with the rain and with the blood that was already there and with the blood that had been there for six months and that no rain would ever wash clean.

He had died standing.

The old ways demanded this. The old ways received it.

The breaking happened in pieces.

The first piece was the sound. A cry — not from the human defenders, not from the orc warriors. From somewhere in the warbands, from the mass of warriors who had poured through the dormitory wall and filled the courtyard and who had watched their Warlord walk toward the human commander and fight and fall. The cry was not a word. It was a frequency. The sound that an army made when the thing that held it together was removed and the holding stopped and the army became a collection of warriors who were each, individually, deciding what the absence of the thing meant and the deciding was happening at the same time and the deciding was producing the same answer.

The second piece was the movement. Warriors stepping backward. Not retreating — stepping, the individual, unconscious withdrawal of bodies whose forward momentum had been driven by the presence of the man at the front and the man was on the cobblestones and the forward had lost its engine.

The third piece was the fragmentation. Warbands separating from warbands. The unified force that had been the Ironclaw army — the instrument that Thokk had wielded for six days, the weapon that had broken the outer ring and blown the barricade and pushed through the dormitory wall — coming apart the way a wall came apart when the keystone was removed. Not collapsing. Fragmenting. Each piece falling in its own direction, at its own speed, the dissolution not chaotic but structural, the army breaking along the seams that Thokk's command had held together and that Thokk's death had released.

Stoneveil watched it happen.

He stood over the body. Not in triumph — in the specific, heavy stillness of a man who had done a thing that could not be undone and who was watching the consequences of the thing move through the world the way a stone's impact moved through water, in concentric rings, each ring wider than the last, each ring carrying the change further from the centre.

The orc warriors pulled back. Building by building. Junction by junction. The retreat that was not a retreat but a withdrawal, the specific, disciplined movement of warbands whose War-Chiefs were taking command in the absence of the Warlord and whose command was the command of survival, the order that said *back* because *forward* had died on the cobblestones and the dying had taken the reason for forward with it.

On the ridge, beyond the outer walls, a flash of orange. Goblin fire. The siege engine positions flaring to life — not firing, burning, the engines being put to the torch by the goblins who had built them. Skrixx Blazebinder's last act. The Pyrelord destroying his own creations before they could be captured, the engineer's final calculation: the engines were finished, the army was finished, but the mind that built them was not, and the mind was leaving, and the leaving required that nothing useful remained behind.

The goblins withdrew north. Through the outer ring. Through the breaches. Into the hills beyond Emberfall, where the Ironclaw's supply lines had been and where the supply lines were becoming escape routes. Forty-six goblins, led by a Pyrelord with burned hands and copper eyes that were already calculating the next thing and the thing after that and the thing that would be built from whatever the ruins provided.

Skrixx survived. The way fire survived — not as a decision but as a definition.

Stoneveil did not pursue. There was nothing to pursue with. The garrison was — the number came, unbidden, the arithmetic that never stopped, the count updating in the space behind his ribs where the count had lived for six days — the garrison was fewer than one hundred. The number would be exact when Veyne's slate calculated it. The number would be small. The number would be the answer to the question that the siege had been asking since Day 1, the question that Stoneveil had been answering with barricade positions and crossfire corridors and the expenditure of men in the grammar of survival: *How many will be left when it's over?*

The answer was coming. The answer would be a number. The number would be carved into stone.

He looked down at the Warlord.

The face was not peaceful. The face was the face of a man who had died in combat — muscles locked, jaw broken, the features set in the expression that the body had worn at the moment of death, the last expression, the one that would stay. The dark eyes were open. They saw nothing. They had stopped seeing when the thing behind them left, and the leaving was the same leaving that every dead man's eyes showed — the departure of the occupant from the structure, the emptying that turned a face from a person into a record.

Stoneveil looked at the face.

He had killed men before. He had killed Overseer Brok Drakhold at Ashgate — a blow through the helmet, the axe splitting iron and bone, the orc commander's body falling from the wall into the pass below. He had felt nothing then. The killing had been tactical, necessary, the removal of a piece from the board that allowed the remaining pieces to survive. He had filed it and moved on.

He could not file this.

The Warlord had not been a piece. The Warlord had been the other side of the same conversation. The man who had fought for the same thing Stoneveil had fought for — survival, continuation, the future of the people behind the wall — and who had lost not because he was wrong but because the seventh strike had found his throat and the finding was the difference and the difference was measured in inches and the inches were the distance between one man's people surviving and another man's people starving.

Stoneveil knelt.

His left arm hung, bleeding. His right hand placed the sword on the cobblestones beside the body. The placing was not ceremony. It was exhaustion. The hand that had been holding the weapon for thirty years setting it down because the fight was over and the hand needed to be empty for a moment, just a moment, so the hand could remember what emptiness felt like before it picked the weapon up again.

He knelt beside the Warlord the way a man knelt beside a thing that demanded acknowledgment. Not a prayer — Stoneveil did not pray. Not a salute — the orc would not have understood a human salute and the salute would have been for Stoneveil's comfort and Stoneveil did not deserve comfort. An acknowledgment. The recognition that the man on the cobblestones had been a man and the killing had been a killing and the killing would go into the room with the forty-three.

The forty-three.

He almost laughed. The sound pressed against his ribs from the inside — not humour, not grief, the convulsive response of a body that had been holding a number too long and the number had grown beyond the room's capacity to hold it. The forty-three. The forty-three had been the number from the Anvil — the ones who pressed against the locked door, the women, the children, the non-combatants who had burned in the firebombing. Forty-three that he carried because someone had to carry them and the carrying was his because the order had been his.

The number was not forty-three anymore.

The number was five hundred and three. The number was every soldier who had died in the six days between the first assault and the seventh strike. The number was every orc warrior who had died in the courtyard and the dormitories and the barricades and the avenue and the alleys and the walls and the gate. The number was the Warlord on the cobblestones. The number was the forty-three and the five hundred and three and the four hundred Ironclaw dead and the number was growing because the dying was not finished, not yet, the wounded were still dying and would die through the night and the night would add to the number and the number would never stop adding because the adding was the cost and the cost was the thing that command carried and the carrying did not end when the fighting ended.

He pressed his left hand against the cobblestones.

The tremor was worse.

He let it be.

He stood. He picked up his sword. The blood on the blade was the Warlord's — dark, already drying, the iron of the blood bonding with the iron of the blade in the oxidation that would become the next layer of residue, the next coat on a surface that had been accumulating coats for thirty years.

He looked south. The gate to the Inner Ring. Closed. Barred. The Ironbound Guard's halberds still visible above the wall's edge, the polished steel catching what light remained.

The courtyard was quiet.

The smoke drifted. The rain fell. The bodies lay where the fighting had placed them — human, orc, the dead indistinguishable in the dim light, the dead always indistinguishable because death was the thing that removed the distinctions and left only the fact of the lying.

Warden Alric Stoneveil stood in the courtyard of the Anvil District and listened to the silence that followed the seventh strike. The silence was not empty. Silences never were. This one was full — full of the things the fighting had produced, the echoes and the absences and the number that was still growing behind his ribs, pressing against the door that was not a door anymore, pushing through the membrane into the space where Stoneveil kept the things he was supposed to keep and the keeping was the cost and the cost was the thing that the silence counted, carefully, precisely, the way Veyne's slate counted, the way the war counted, the way the world of Bloodhollow counted — in bodies, in blood, in the specific weight of what had been spent to hold a gate that had never opened.

His left hand trembled.

He let it.
