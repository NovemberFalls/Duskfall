# CHAPTER NINETEEN: STREET BY STREET

## Day 5 — The Anvil

---

The sword broke on the third orc.

Not cleanly — not the way swords broke in the stories, the blade snapping at the hilt with a bright, ringing crack that signalled the end of one weapon and the beginning of another. It broke the way things broke in the Anvil District: ugly, incomplete, wrong. The edge caught on the orc's pauldron — a plate of beaten iron bolted over boiled leather, crude work, the kind of armour that was assembled from salvage rather than forged from design — and the blade twisted in November's grip, the stress travelling through the steel in a way he felt more than heard, a vibration that said the metal had reached the limit of what metal could be asked to do by a man who was asking too much of everything.

The blade held for another strike. A clumsy overhead cut that caught the orc across the forearm and drew blood but didn't stop him — didn't even slow him, the warrior absorbing the wound the way warriors absorbed wounds, with a grunt and a pivot and a counter-swing that November ducked under more by accident than design, his body folding at the waist because his legs were already buckling and the buckling happened to move his head below the arc of the axe.

Then the third strike, and the sword snapped.

The break point was six inches above the cross-guard. The blade separated into two pieces — the longer one spinning away into the rubble, a flash of dull steel against the ash-black ground, gone before November's eyes could track it. The shorter piece remained in his hand: the grip, the cross-guard, and a jagged stump of metal that was no longer a sword but was also no longer nothing. It was six inches of broken steel, and six inches was enough to kill if you were close enough and desperate enough and the man you were fighting wasn't expecting a weapon that had stopped being a weapon.

November was close enough. November was desperate enough.

The orc wasn't expecting it.

November drove the stump forward — not a thrust, not a trained motion, the ugly, convulsive lunge of a man whose hands had been told the fight was over and whose body had not received the message. The broken edge caught the orc below the jaw, in the gap between the helmet's rim and the gorget that covered the throat, the inch of exposed flesh that armour always left because armour was a compromise between protection and movement and the compromise was always measured in inches.

The orc made a sound. Not a scream — a sound, the wet, abbreviated noise of a body discovering that the thing keeping it alive had been interrupted. He fell. Not backward — forward, into November, the weight of a dying man in armour pressing against November's chest and driving him into the rubble behind him, the two of them going down together, the orc's blood spreading across November's shoulder and neck and the side of his face in a warm, spreading sheet that smelled of copper and something else, something organic and intimate that he would never forget because the body remembered what the mind wanted to erase.

November pushed the body off. His right arm — the only arm that worked, the arm that had been his entire body's contribution to the war for five days — screamed in protest. The muscles were past fatigue and into the territory beyond, the place where tendons and fibres operated on the stored reserves of what the body could produce after everything had been spent. He pushed and the orc rolled and November was on his back in the rubble of a street he didn't recognise, staring at a sky that was amber and black and belonged to a world he no longer understood.

He lay there for two breaths. Three.

Then he got up.

---

The Anvil District was dying for the second time.

The orcs had come at dawn — not the probing assaults of the previous day but a full press, hundreds of warriors pouring through the northern approach and the eastern access in coordinated waves that hit Stoneveil's barricades like water against a dam. November had been at the northern barricade when the first wave struck. Position Two — one of the converted forge-shops along the main avenue, the building that had been someone's livelihood before Stoneveil's firebombing and had been a fighting position since yesterday and was now a ruin for the second time because the orc siege engines had found the range and the first round of the morning had taken the roof off and the second had collapsed the eastern wall and the third had landed in the street outside and showered the interior with stone fragments that killed Legionnaire Fen and wounded three others.

The barricade held for two hours. Then it didn't.

November didn't see the moment it fell. He was inside Position Two when the northern barricade was flanked — orcs coming through the buildings on either side, through the walls that the firebombing had weakened six months ago and that the orcs' weight and fury finished, pouring into the avenue behind the barricade and cutting off the sections that were holding it. The sound changed — the rhythm of defended positions becoming the chaos of a position overrun, the percussion of combat losing its shape and becoming noise, the kind of noise that meant the line was gone and what remained was individuals fighting in the wreckage of a plan.

Rath's composite unit fragmented.

November didn't see that either. One moment the unit was there — the eighteen men who had been twenty-three on Day 2 and eighteen after the retreat and seventeen after Fen — and then the smoke and the rubble and the orc assault tore the unit apart the way the siege tore everything apart: not all at once but in pieces, in fragments, in the individual separations that happened when a man turned left instead of right, when a wall collapsed between two soldiers, when the retreat from a position scattered fighters into different streets and the streets led to different corners and the corners were where you ended up alone.

November ended up alone.

Not immediately. For a stretch — ten minutes, twenty, the time impossible to measure because time in street fighting was not a line but a series of collisions, each one consuming whatever time existed between it and the next — he was with Edric and two Legionnaires whose names he didn't know, the four of them moving south through the rubble of Forge Road, heading for the secondary barricade that Stoneveil had built behind the first. The Legionnaires were faster. They were always faster — trained men in armour that fit, with weapons they'd held since boyhood and footwork that found solid ground the way water found the lowest point. They moved through the ruins with a certainty that November could not match, his borrowed boots sliding on the ash-slick cobblestones, his feet finding the wrong surfaces, his body navigating the rubble the way a man navigated a language he'd learned late: with effort, with mistakes, with the constant awareness that the men beside him were native speakers and he was translating every step.

They reached a junction. The two Legionnaires went right — toward the sound of fighting, toward the section of the secondary barricade where the defence was loudest. They didn't wait. They didn't check. They moved toward the combat with the automatic, magnetic certainty of trained men responding to the sound of their own, and they were gone into the smoke before November could open his mouth.

He went left. Edric went left. The left was away from the heaviest fighting, toward the southern edge of the district, toward the civilian shelters that Stoneveil had established in the old worker dormitories behind the secondary barricade. The compass pointed that way — not because the fighting was there but because the people who couldn't fight were there, and the Creed's architecture was built on a single load-bearing truth: *we fight so that those who cannot defend themselves have a defender.*

They were separated forty paces later.

A wall came down. Not an explosion — structural failure, the slow-motion collapse of a building that the firebombing had gutted and the bombardment had cracked and the vibration of the fighting had finally, patiently, finished. The wall between two forge-shops folded inward — the masonry cascading in a waterfall of stone and burnt timber that filled the narrow street from building to building, a barrier ten feet high and twenty feet wide that arrived in the space between one step and the next.

November was on one side. Edric was on the other.

"November!"

The voice came through the rubble — muffled, distant, the sound travelling through stone the way sound travelled through stone: badly, incompletely, the words losing their edges.

"I'm here," November said. His voice was a rasp. Five days of smoke and shouting had reduced it to something that sounded like gravel in a tin cup. "Go south. Find the secondary barricade."

"I can—"

"Go south, Edric."

Silence. The sound of the fighting. The sound of stone settling.

"South," Edric said. The word came through the wall, and in the word November heard the thing that had been growing between them for five days — the boy who had put his shield over a civilian, who had carried Brenn through the retreat, who had said *I know* when November told him the Creed, who had learned what he believed and believed it with the weight of a hammer falling on an anvil. The boy who trusted November enough to go when November told him to go, because the trust was the same shape as the Creed and the Creed said *we do not abandon* but the Creed also said *we fight so that those who cannot defend themselves have a defender* and the only way to defend the people in the southern shelters was to reach them.

November heard his boots on the cobblestones. Moving south. Getting quieter.

He turned north.

---

He found a sword in the rubble.

Not a good sword — there were no good swords left in the Anvil District, only the swords that remained, the weapons that had been dropped or lost or left beside the men who'd been carrying them when the carrying stopped. This one was wedged beneath a piece of timber, the blade dark with dried blood, the grip wrapped in leather that was cracked and sweat-stained and bore the marks of a hand that had held it hard enough to leave its shape in the material.

November pulled it free. The weight was wrong — heavier than the borrowed sword, the balance shifted toward the tip in a way that made every swing feel like he was fighting the weapon as well as the enemy. It was a Legionnaire's sword, built for men who had been trained to use the weight, who knew how to let the blade's momentum carry the stroke and redirect it into the next. November did not know how to do this. November knew how to hold a piece of metal and put it between himself and the thing trying to kill him.

He adjusted his grip. Too tight. The same mistake. The one Horus had diagnosed from a blister in a morning that belonged to a different lifetime.

He didn't loosen it.

The street ahead was smoke and noise. The fighting had spread through the district the way fire spread — not in lines but in pools, pockets of combat forming and dissolving as orc warbands and scattered defenders met in the alleys and junctions and the ruins of buildings that had been homes and forges and shops and were now the geography of killing. November moved through it the way he moved through everything in the siege: forward, because forward was the direction the compass pointed and the compass did not have a setting for backward.

He found Legionnaire Darya at the junction of Forge Road and a side street he had no name for.

She was fighting two orcs.

November knew she was a Legionnaire by the armour. He knew she was Darya because she had been on Rath's section for two days — a woman in her thirties, quiet, efficient, the kind of soldier who communicated in nods and the precise placement of her shield and the absolute, unwavering reliability of a person who was exactly where she was supposed to be at exactly the moment she was supposed to be there.

She was better than November. Faster. Cleaner. Her sword moved in the short, controlled arcs of a fighter who had spent years learning where to put the blade and where to take it back, the economy of motion that separated trained soldiers from men with borrowed weapons. She took the first orc's leg at the knee — a low, sweeping cut that dropped him, the strike so fast November's eyes barely tracked it — and pivoted to face the second, her shield up, her weight shifting, the ballet of violence that November watched the way he'd watched the soldiers in the training yard: with recognition, with the understanding that the thing those men had was the thing he did not have and might never have.

November hit the second orc from behind.

Not gracefully. He came around the corner of the ruined forge-shop and swung the heavy sword with both hands — his right doing the work, his left contributing nothing but presence, the arm that had been useless since Day 1 along for the ride because the grip required two hands and two hands was what he had even if one of them was a formality. The blade caught the orc across the back, between the shoulder blades, where the armour was thinnest. The impact jarred up November's arms and into his shoulders and he felt the sword bite through the leather and into the flesh beneath and the orc staggered forward and Darya finished him with a thrust that was clinical and precise and over before November's sword had completed its arc.

The orc fell.

Darya looked at him. The assessment was fast — her eyes moving over his face, his body, the sword in his hands, the left arm that hung wrong, the absence of armour, the presence of blood that was not all his. The assessment produced a conclusion. The conclusion was a nod.

"With me," she said.

November went with her.

---

They fought south for twenty minutes.

Twenty minutes that contained three engagements — a warband of six that they met at a barricade remnant and fought through with the help of two Legionnaires who emerged from a forge-shop on the left; a pair of orc scouts that Darya killed so efficiently November didn't have time to raise his sword; and the three orcs in the side street, the ones where November's sword broke.

In between the fighting, they moved. Through the rubble. Through the smoke that was thicker now than it had been at dawn, the fires from the bombardment feeding on the buildings' timber frames and producing a haze that turned the district into a landscape of shapes — walls that appeared and dissolved, streets that narrowed to nothing, the particular, nightmarish geography of a place that had been destroyed and rebuilt and was being destroyed again.

November's body was a catalogue of costs.

The left arm — useless since Day 1, the joint swollen beneath Edric's binding, the muscles seized into a permanent, grinding cramp that he carried the way he carried the Creed: always, invisibly, as a fact. The ribs — bruised from the stone that hit his back during the retreat, the pain a band that tightened with every breath and loosened with none. His right hand — blistered, reblistered, the callus that Horus had diagnosed cracked open and bleeding into the leather grip of the new sword. A cut on his left thigh from the first engagement — shallow, the blood soaking into the fabric of his trousers in a dark stain that he noticed only when the leg started stiffening and the stiffness forced a limp that made the moving slower and the slowness made the surviving harder.

He checked the compass.

*Standing?*

Barely. The word had taken on a different meaning since Day 1. Standing on Day 1 had been a fact — the simple, physical reality of a body that was upright. Standing on Day 5 was an argument. A negotiation between the parts of him that worked and the parts that didn't, mediated by the part that refused to acknowledge the difference.

*Sober?*

Five days. The bottle was not even a memory anymore. It was a concept from someone else's life, the way the training yard was a concept, the way the morning with Horus was a concept — things that had existed in a world that operated on different rules, a world where the worst damage a person sustained was a blister and the worst failure was a dropped guard on the left side.

*The Creed?*

He was fighting. He was bleeding. He was moving south because south was where the people who couldn't fight were, and the Creed said defend them. He was doing what the compass pointed at, the way he always did, the way he always would, because the compass was the only instrument that worked in a city where everything else was broken.

Darya stopped.

They were at a junction — Forge Road meeting a wider avenue that November recognised as the main approach to the secondary barricade. The barricade was visible through the smoke: a wall of rubble and timber and the broken furniture of ruined houses, chest-high, manned by defenders whose faces were masks of soot and exhaustion. Behind the barricade, the southern edge of the district — the dormitories, the shelters, the place where the civilians were.

"There." Darya pointed south. "Fall back to the barricade. They need—"

The spear came from the right.

November saw it. Not the spear — the movement. The shape in the smoke that resolved into an orc at a run, the weapon extended, the thrust aimed at the junction where they stood, at the woman who had her back to the side street because she was pointing south and the south was the direction that mattered and the thing that killed you was always the direction that didn't.

"Darya!"

The warning came too late and too slow and it didn't matter because Darya was already turning — the soldier's instinct, the body responding to the sound of her name said with that particular urgency, the pivot that should have brought her shield around and her sword up and her weight into the stance that would have caught the thrust and redirected it.

The spear went through her throat.

The point entered below the left ear and exited below the right jaw and the spray was immediate and total and the sound she made was not a sound but the absence of sound, the wet, choking silence of a throat that had been a throat a moment ago and was now a wound.

She fell.

The orc pulled the spear free. The motion was practiced — the quick, twisting withdrawal of a warrior who had done this before and would do it again and the doing was as natural as breathing. He raised the spear for a second thrust, aiming down, at the body on the ground that was still moving, the muscles firing without command, the hands opening and closing on nothing.

November hit him.

Not with skill. With mass. With the full, desperate, lunging weight of a man who had watched three people die today and was refusing to watch a fourth, even though watching was all he had left because his sword was broken and his arm was useless and his body was a ledger of debts that the siege had been collecting for five days. He hit the orc the way a wall falls — with everything, without technique, the collision of a body that was running on nothing but the compass and the compass was screaming.

The orc staggered. November was on top of him — tangled, grappling, the broken stump of the sword somewhere behind him in the rubble, his right hand finding the orc's wrist, the spear trapped between their bodies. The orc was stronger. The orc was always stronger — November had learned this on Day 2, the fundamental lesson of fighting things that were built for fighting: they were better at it than he was. The orc twisted, broke the grip, drove an elbow into November's ribs that compressed the bruised bones and sent a flare of pain through his chest that turned his vision white and then red and then the colour that lived beyond the spectrum.

A sword came down.

Not November's. A Legionnaire's — one of the barricade defenders, a man who had seen the fight at the junction and had come forward, his blade catching the orc at the junction of neck and shoulder in a stroke that ended the fight the way professional violence ended fights: suddenly, with a sound, with a body going still.

November lay in the rubble beside Darya.

She was dying. Not the fast dying — the slow kind, the kind that was measured in breaths and each breath was shorter than the last and the last was coming and the coming was a countdown that November could hear in the wet, bubbling sound her throat made as it tried to do the thing it could no longer do.

He pulled himself to her. His right hand found hers. Her fingers were still warm. Still strong — the grip of a woman who had been holding a sword thirty seconds ago and whose hands hadn't learned that the holding was over.

Her eyes were open. They found his — the same assessment she'd made in the junction, the fast, professional evaluation. But the conclusion was different now. The conclusion was not a nod. It was the thing beyond the nod, the look that happened when the assessment reached the end of the list and the list said nothing more could be done and the nothing was the answer.

November held her hand.

He didn't say anything. There was nothing to say that the moment didn't already contain — the sound of the fighting, the smoke, the sky that was amber and black, the cobblestones that were wet with blood that was hers and blood that was his and blood that belonged to the orc beside them and the blood didn't care whose it was because blood on cobblestones was the same regardless of who it had been keeping alive.

Her grip loosened. Her fingers opened. Her eyes stayed open but the thing behind them — the assessment, the certainty, the presence of a woman who had been exactly where she was supposed to be — went somewhere else.

November sat with her for three breaths. Four.

The third person today.

He let go of her hand. Picked up her sword — lighter than the one he'd broken, better balanced, the weapon of a soldier who had chosen it to fit her grip and her stance and her way of making violence efficient. The leather grip was warm. It fit his hand better than any weapon he'd held in five days, and the fitting was a cruelty he felt in his chest, because the sword fit him because its owner was dead and dead people didn't need their swords to fit.

He stood.

The Legionnaire who had killed the orc was looking at him. The same assessment. The same conclusion Darya had reached on the first look: civilian, wounded, wrong weapon, wrong place, still there. The Legionnaire's eyes moved to the blood on November's face, the arm that hung wrong, the cut on his thigh, the body that was a catalogue of the ways a siege could diminish a man without killing him.

"You the civilian?"

"Yes."

"Rath's unit?"

"What's left of it."

The Legionnaire looked south, toward the barricade. Then north, where the sound of fighting was louder, closer, the orc assault pushing deeper into the district with every minute.

"Get behind the barricade," the Legionnaire said. "We're falling back to—"

The bombardment hit.

---

The round landed fifty paces north. Close enough to feel — the compression of air, the percussion that was not sound but force, the debris that filled the street like a horizontal rain of stone and timber. November went down. Not from the blast — from the aftermath, the shower of fragments that peppered the junction and sent the Legionnaire stumbling sideways and drove November to his knees behind the remnant of a wall that might have been a shop counter and was now a piece of cover that he pressed his back against and breathed through the dust that filled his lungs.

When the dust cleared — not cleared, thinned, the dust in the Anvil District didn't clear, it just rearranged — November heard two things.

The first was fighting. Ahead — north, up Forge Road, past the junction where Darya's body lay. The sound of a defensive position being overrun. Shields cracking. Men shouting. The compressed, desperate noise of defenders being pushed back, the barricade remnants along the northern approach giving way, the orcs pouring through in numbers that the depleted sections couldn't hold.

The second was screaming. Behind — south, past the secondary barricade. Not the screaming of men. The screaming of people who were not supposed to be in the fighting — higher, thinner, carrying a different frequency, the sound of terror rather than combat. Civilians. The bombardment round had landed close to the secondary barricade, and the buildings behind it — the dormitories, the shelters — were the buildings where Stoneveil had put the people who couldn't fight.

November looked north.

Through the smoke, shapes. Legionnaires, falling back. Five — six — the remnants of the sections that had been holding the northern approach, being driven south by the orc advance, fighting a withdrawal that was measured in bodies and paces and the specific, intimate currency of men spending their lives to buy ground. They were fighting. They were losing. They needed help — more swords, more shields, more bodies on the line to slow the advance that was eating the district building by building, block by block, the tide that would reach the secondary barricade in minutes if nothing stopped it.

November looked south.

Through the smoke, shapes. Not soldiers. Civilians — emerging from the dormitory buildings, stumbling into the street behind the barricade, the people who had been sheltering in the southern edge of the district discovering that the bombardment had found them. A building was collapsed — the eastern wall of the old apprentice quarters had folded, the masonry cascading inward, and November could hear them. Inside. Under the rubble. The sound that rubble made when people were under it — the muffled voices, the crying, the particular, horrible acoustics of human beings trapped beneath stone and calling for the outside to come in.

He stood at the junction.

North: soldiers dying. Men who had taken up swords and put on armour and walked onto a wall knowing that the wall was where the dying happened. Men who had chosen this. Who had trained for this. Who understood, in the way that soldiers understood, that the cost of the uniform was the body inside it.

South: civilians trapped. People who had not chosen. Who had not trained. Who had been told to shelter in the dormitories because the dormitories were behind the barricade and behind the barricade was supposed to be safe, the word *safe* carrying the weight of a promise made by a system that was failing to keep its promises.

He could not do both.

The realisation arrived not as a thought but as a physical sensation — a constriction in his chest, the compass tightening, the inner mechanism encountering a load it was not designed for. Two directions. Two needs. One body. The mathematics were the same mathematics the siege produced at every turn: the equation that said something must be left behind, and the thing left behind was the thing that someone else would have to carry.

The Legionnaire from the barricade was already moving north. Running toward the fighting, toward the retreating sections, toward the line that needed holding. The trained response. The soldier's response. The response of a man who understood that the military threat was the primary threat and the primary threat received the primary response.

November did not move north.

The compass turned. South. Toward the screaming. Toward the rubble and the voices under it and the people who could not defend themselves and who needed a defender.

*We fight so that those who cannot defend themselves have a defender.*

He stood in the junction and the Creed spoke, and the Creed did not say *we fight so that the strongest are reinforced.* The Creed did not say *we fight where the military calculates the greatest need.* The Creed said what it said, and what it said was what he was, and what he was stood in a junction in a burning city and looked south because south was where the defenceless were and the defenceless were his.

The soldiers to the north would die.

Not all of them. Maybe not any of them — the barricade defenders were moving to reinforce, the military system grinding into response, the trained men doing the trained thing. But the margin was thin, and November's body on that line — one more sword, one more man, the presence of a person who would not leave — might have been the margin. Might have been the weight that held the line for another minute, another five, the time that separated a position held from a position lost.

He would never know.

He turned south.

---

The dormitory was half-collapsed.

The eastern wall was gone — brought down by the bombardment round, the masonry folded inward in a cascade that had buried the ground floor beneath several tons of stone and timber. Dust hung in the air like fog, thick enough to taste, the particulate of a building that had existed for a hundred years and had been reduced to rubble in a second.

November reached it at a run. The run was not a run — it was the fastest his body could move, which was a kind of staggering lope that favoured his right leg and dragged the left and covered ground the way a man in deep water covered ground: with effort, with the resistance of a body moving through a medium that didn't want him to move.

People were emerging from the western end of the building — the end that hadn't collapsed, the rooms that had been shaken but not buried. Civilians. Women with children. An old man leaning on a woman half his age. Their faces were grey with dust, their eyes wide with the specific, unfocused terror of people who had been told they were safe and had been educated otherwise by the ceiling falling on them.

"How many inside?" November grabbed the arm of a woman coming through the doorway. She flinched — the automatic recoil of a person who had been grabbed before and the grabbing had not been kind. He released. "How many people are still inside?"

"The — the eastern rooms." Her voice was shaking. Not with fear — with the aftermath of fear, the tremor that arrived after the worst was over and the body was allowed to acknowledge what the worst had been. "There were families. Eight — ten — I don't know. The ceiling came down—"

"Is there access? Can I get through?"

She looked at him. At the blood on his face. The arm. The sword in his hand. The absence of armour. The presence of a man who was asking about access instead of running south, toward the barricade, toward the place where the running was supposed to end.

"The corridor," she said. "The main corridor — it might be passable. I don't—"

November went in.

The building's interior was dark. The collapse of the eastern wall had brought down portions of the ceiling, and the dust was so thick that the light from the western windows reached maybe ten paces before it was absorbed. November moved through it by feel — his right hand on the wall, the sword in his left hip scabbard because the sword was useless here, the work ahead was not fighting but lifting, and lifting required hands, and he had one.

The corridor ran east-west through the building's centre. The western half was intact — cracked plaster, fallen shelves, the debris of a building that had been shaken but not destroyed. He passed rooms that were empty, rooms that had been occupied minutes ago and were now abandoned, the personal effects of refugees scattered across the floors: blankets, a cook pot, a child's shoe lying on its side in a shaft of grey light.

He moved east.

The debris thickened. Fallen timbers across the corridor — he climbed over the first, crawled under the second, the space between the timber and the floor barely wide enough for his shoulders. His left arm caught on the wood and the pain was a flare that whited out his vision and he bit through the inside of his cheek and tasted blood and kept moving because the voices were ahead of him now, close, the muffled sounds of people calling from behind stone.

"I'm here!" His voice, the gravel rasp. "I'm coming!"

The corridor ended in rubble. A wall of stone and timber that filled the passage from floor to ceiling — the collapse, the eastern wall's debris pushed inward, the barrier between him and the rooms beyond. The voices were on the other side. Two voices — a woman's, speaking fast, the words indistinguishable, and a child's, not words at all, the high, keening sound of a child who was frightened beyond language.

November dug.

One hand. His right hand, the blistered, bleeding, callused hand that had held a training blade and a borrowed sword and a broken stump and Darya's fingers and was now pulling stones from a wall of rubble in a collapsed building while a battle raged outside. He pulled and the stones came — some of them, the ones that were loose, the pieces that the collapse had deposited without the weight of the pieces above locking them in place. He stacked them behind him. Pulled more. The work was the same work he'd done in the Hall of the Fallen on Day 1, digging for Horus in the overflow ward — the same desperate, one-armed excavation, the same grinding, methodical removal of the things that stood between him and the person on the other side.

He didn't find Horus then.

He kept digging.

A gap opened. Not wide — enough for his arm to reach through, enough to feel the air on the other side, the slightly cooler, slightly cleaner air of a room that had not been fully buried. He pulled more stones. Widened the gap. His hand was bleeding — the skin torn, the callus that had been a blister that had been a bandage gone, the raw flesh of a palm that was being used as a tool because tools were what the moment required and the body was the only tool available.

"Can you move?" he called through the gap. "Can you reach me?"

A hand. Small. A child's hand, reaching through the gap, the fingers coated in dust, the grip closing on November's wrist with a strength that had nothing to do with muscles and everything to do with the universal, wordless communication of a body that had found another body in the dark and would not let go.

"I've got you," November said. "I've got you."

He pulled more stones. Widened the gap. The child came through — a boy, maybe seven, his face white with plaster dust, his eyes enormous, his mouth open but silent now, the sound he'd been making replaced by the specific, trembling quiet of a child who was being rescued and hadn't yet decided whether the rescue was real.

November set him down behind the rubble, in the corridor, in the section that was still standing.

"Wait here."

He went back to the gap. Wider now. A woman's face — young, maybe his age, her hair white with dust, a cut above her eyebrow that was bleeding into her eye. She was holding something. Another child — younger, two or three, the small body pressed against her chest in the hold of a mother who had decided that the thing she was holding was the thing she would not let go of, regardless of what the ceiling did.

"Can you fit through?"

"Not with—" She looked at the child in her arms. The gap was wide enough for a body. Not wide enough for a body holding another body. The mathematics again. The siege's constant, grinding equation.

November pulled more stones. His hand was a ruin — the skin gone, the flesh raw, the blood mixing with the dust to form a paste that coated the stones as he moved them. The pain was past the point of individual sensation. It had joined the left arm and the ribs and the thigh in the general, collective chorus of a body that was past its limits and was being asked to go further and was going because the compass didn't know the word *limit.*

The gap widened. Enough. The woman came through — sideways, her shoulder catching on a timber, the child pressed to her chest, the small body sheltered from the stone by her body the way a wall sheltered the city from the siege. She emerged into the corridor gasping, coughing, the dust filling her lungs the way it filled everyone's lungs, the air of the Anvil District demanding payment from everyone who breathed it.

"Are there more?" November asked.

"Two — in the back room. An old woman and a man. His legs—"

"I'll get them."

"The ceiling — the room is — it's coming apart. The timbers—"

November went through the gap.

The room beyond was failing.

He could see it — the timber beams that supported the ceiling bowing under the weight of the collapsed floor above, the plaster cracking in patterns that spread like veins, the structure announcing its intention to finish what the bombardment had started. The room had been a sleeping quarters — pallets on the floor, blankets, the sparse possessions of refugees who had carried what they could from the outer ring. A lamp was overturned in the corner, the oil spreading in a dark stain across the floor.

The old woman was sitting against the far wall. Not sitting — propped, her back against the stone, her legs extended, her face set in the particular, still expression of a person who had decided that the situation was the situation and her response was to wait and see what the situation decided to do about her. She was not panicking. She had, November suspected, seen enough of Bloodhollow's emergencies to know that panicking was a luxury she could not afford and would not purchase.

The man was beside her. Younger — maybe thirty, his legs buried under a section of wall that had come down at an angle, the masonry pinning him from the hip down. He was conscious. His face was grey. Not the grey of dust — the grey of pain, the familiar colour that November had learned to read in five days of dragging wounded men to triage stations.

"The wall's going," the man said. His voice was calm in the way that shock made people calm — the body's anaesthetic overriding the information the body was receiving. "You should take her and go."

November looked at the wall. The man was right — the masonry pinning his legs was part of a larger section that was still connected to the eastern wall above, and the eastern wall above was connected to nothing because the nothing was where the wall used to be before the bombardment turned it into rubble. The section could shift. Could come down further. Could bury all three of them if the structure decided to finish its collapse.

*We do not abandon.*

November knelt beside the old woman first. "Can you walk?"

"I can walk." Her voice was clear, dry, the voice of a woman who had survived enough to know what walking was worth and was prepared to do it. "Help the boy."

November looked at her. She was looking at the man with the buried legs — the man she had called *boy* despite his being twice her age, the designation carrying the weight of familiarity, of knowing someone long enough that the words you used for them had nothing to do with accuracy and everything to do with habit.

"I'm going to move the stones," November said to the man. "I need you to pull yourself out when the weight lifts."

"The wall—"

"I know about the wall."

He braced himself against the largest piece of masonry. His right hand flat against the stone, his shoulder against the edge, his legs set in the position that delivered the most force — the position he'd learned not from training but from three months of dragging pallets and lifting patients in the Hall of the Fallen, the body's knowledge of how to move things that were heavier than the body moving them.

He pushed.

The masonry shifted. An inch. The weight was enormous — the mass of a wall section that had been built to last a century and was being asked to move by a man whose body had been asked to do too much for too long. His legs burned. His back screamed. His right arm trembled with the effort, the muscles reaching the end of what muscles could do.

He pushed harder.

The masonry shifted again. Two inches. Three. The man was pulling — his arms hooked under his own legs, dragging himself backward, the motion agonising, the sound he made the sound of a body discovering what it cost to move parts that had been pinned and compressed and the moving was the price and the price was pain.

A timber cracked above them. The sound was not loud — the quiet, decisive snap of wood exceeding its tolerance, the structure's announcement that the countdown had entered its final phase.

The man pulled free.

November released the masonry. It settled back — the wall section returning to the position the collapse had given it, the stone finding its resting place with a grinding finality that said the resting was permanent and the room's participation in the architecture of shelter was over.

"Move," November said.

The old woman was already moving. She had the man's arm over her shoulders — the man whose legs were free but not functional, the man who was trying to walk on limbs that had been pinned under a wall and were not ready to receive instructions. The old woman carried him the way November had carried Brenn — with stubbornness, with the refusal to accept that the weight was too much, with the particular, indomitable strength of a person who had decided that the thing she was carrying was the thing she would carry.

November followed them to the gap. Helped the man through. Helped the old woman through. The timbers above cracked again — louder, a sequence of snaps that ran along the ceiling like the sound of bones breaking in order, the structure's final warning delivered in the language of physics.

He went through the gap.

The corridor. The boy with the enormous eyes. The woman with the younger child. The old woman and the man with the damaged legs. Five people. Five people who had been under the rubble and were now not under the rubble because a man with one working arm and a borrowed sword had dug through a wall and pushed a section of masonry off a man's legs and the pushing and the digging were the Creed made physical, the words turned into action, the action turned into the five bodies standing in a corridor that still stood.

November led them west.

Through the corridor. Over the timbers. Past the empty rooms with the scattered blankets and the cook pot and the child's shoe. Into the light — the grey, smoke-filtered light of the Anvil District, the light that was wrong the way the sky was wrong, the way everything was wrong, the wrongness so constant now that it had become the standard and the old standard was the thing that felt impossible.

Outside, the fighting continued.

He could hear it — north, the sound of the line holding or not holding, the orc assault meeting the defenders at the secondary barricade in the collision that would determine whether the southern edge of the district survived the day. The sound was close. Closer than when he'd gone in. The fighting had moved south while he'd been digging, the orcs pushing, the defenders falling back, the district compressing the way everything compressed in a siege — smaller, tighter, the fist closing.

November stood at the doorway and listened.

The soldiers to the north had held. Or they hadn't, and the holding was still being decided, and the deciding was being measured in the bodies of men who had chosen to fight. He would never know if his presence on that line — one more sword, one more body, the weight of a man who would not leave — would have changed the outcome. The mathematics were beyond him. The mathematics were beyond anyone standing in the ruins of a district that had been built and burned and built again and was being burned again.

He knew what he had done.

Five people. Two of them children. One old woman who called a grown man *boy* and carried him on her shoulders. A mother who held her child like a shield held its bearer — with the whole body, with everything.

The Creed did not calculate. The Creed said what it said: *we fight so that those who cannot defend themselves have a defender.* The soldiers to the north could fight. The people under the rubble could not. November had gone where the Creed pointed. He had gone to the defenceless because the defenceless were his, and the going was the choice, and the choice was the man, and the man stood in the doorway with blood on his hands and dust in his lungs and the weight of five lives on the side of the ledger that mattered.

He would carry the other weight too. The weight of the soldiers who may have died because he wasn't there. The defenders who may have needed one more body on the line. The margin he might have been and wasn't. He would carry that weight the way he carried everything — without setting it down, without pretending it wasn't there, in the space beside the Creed where the costs were kept and the costs were honest.

The compass settled.

*Standing?*

Yes. In a doorway. In the ruins. With a dead woman's sword and a body that had been past its limit since Day 3 and was operating on whatever fuel remained when the fuel ran out — stubbornness, probably, the grinding, graceless, human refusal to accept that the arithmetic's answer was the final answer.

*Sober?*

Five days.

*The Creed?*

He thought about Darya. The spear through her throat. The way her grip had loosened. The way her eyes had stayed open and the thing behind them had gone somewhere else.

He thought about the man on the cobblestones — the third person today, the orc he'd killed with a broken stump of sword, the weight of a body going limp against his chest, the blood spreading across his shoulder and neck in the warm sheet that he would never forget because the body remembered what the mind wanted to erase.

He thought about the boy with the enormous eyes. The mother with the child pressed against her chest. The old woman who carried her *boy* on her shoulders. The gap in the wall that his one hand had made wider.

*Did I live the Creed?*

The answer was not clean. The answer was never clean. The Creed lived in a world where choices had costs and the costs were paid by people who didn't get to choose, and the paying was the thing that made the Creed necessary and the Creed insufficient and the Creed all he had.

He had defended those who could not defend themselves.

He had left those who could.

Both of those things were true. Both of them would stay. He would carry both the way he carried everything — forward, without setting down, into whatever the Anvil District demanded next.

He looked north. The fighting was still there — the sound of it, the percussion of shields and the voices of men, the grinding, desperate music of a siege entering its final movements. The secondary barricade was holding. For now. The soldiers were doing what soldiers did: spending themselves in increments, the way candles spent themselves, steadily, visibly, the brightness a countdown.

November gripped Darya's sword.

Too tight. The same mistake.

He walked toward the barricade.
