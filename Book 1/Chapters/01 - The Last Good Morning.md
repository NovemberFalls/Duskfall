# CHAPTER ONE: THE LAST GOOD MORNING

## Day 1 — Before the Siege

---

November woke before the light.

He always did. Five hours and his body was done with sleep — had been that way since he was a boy, since before the war took his father and the skirmishes took his mother and the bottle nearly took him. Five hours, and then the dark pressed against his eyelids like a hand, and he was awake whether he wanted to be or not.

He lay still for a moment. Listened.

The Hall of the Fallen breathed around him — the low creak of roof timbers settling in the pre-dawn cold, the whisper of wind through the gaps in the shutters where the frames had warped and no one had gotten around to fixing them. Somewhere deeper in the building, a man was coughing — wet, persistent, the kind of cough that had been going on so long it had become part of the Hall's architecture, as much a fixture as the stone walls and the narrow windows that let in the light but never quite enough of it.

Beside him, Horus slept.

She slept the way she did everything — efficiently. On her side, one arm folded under her head, the other resting across the gap between them where, at some point in the night, her fingers had found the edge of his sleeve and held on. Her breathing was even. Steady. The rhythm of a woman who had spent the day setting bones and closing wounds and washing blood from her hands until the water ran clear, and who had collapsed into sleep the way a wall collapses — all at once, without negotiation.

Her hair was loose. She wore it tied back during work — a thick rope of dark brown pinned with whatever was closest, a strip of linen, a length of twine, once a piece of copper wire she'd pulled from a splint — but in sleep it fanned across the pillow in a way that made her look younger than she was. Softer. As if the woman who held men steady while they screamed was, in the dark, just a woman who was tired.

November watched her for a while. Not because he was romantic about it — he was, but that wasn't why. He watched her because there had been a time, not so long ago, when he'd woken in rooms he didn't recognize with a mouth full of blood and a headache that started behind his eyes and ended somewhere near the base of his spine, and the only thing waiting for him was the certainty that the day ahead would be indistinguishable from the day behind.

Now there was this.

He could have stayed. The pull of it was real — the warmth of the cot, the weight of the thin wool blanket they shared because the Hall didn't have enough for both the patients and the staff, the proximity of a person who had decided, for reasons he had never fully understood, that he was worth the effort.

But the training yard wouldn't come to him.

He eased himself up. Carefully. The cot was narrow and old, and it complained about everything — shifting weight, cold air, the indignity of holding two people who should have had separate beds but didn't because the Hall's storage room had become an overflow ward three weeks ago and the only space left was the one Horus had carved out behind the linen shelves, barely wide enough for the cot and a stool and the small iron hook where she hung her apron.

He set his feet on the stone floor. Cold. The kind of cold that climbed through the soles and settled into the ankles, the permanent chill of a building that had been built to store grain before someone converted it into a place for the dying.

Horus's fingers tightened on his sleeve. Briefly. Then let go.

He pulled on his boots and his coat and left her sleeping.

---

The training yard was empty.

It was always empty at this hour, which was the reason November used it. The soldiers trained here in shifts — morning drills from the sixth bell, weapons practice until midday, then the afternoon formations that turned the yard into a grid of shields and spears and men shouting numbers at each other. By the time the fifth bell rang, the yard belonged to the dust and the silence and the man who was too early for everything except the work of trying to become someone worth being.

He'd found the yard two months after he stopped drinking. The first time, he'd stood at the edge of it and watched the soldiers move through their forms — the precise, clean geometry of trained men cutting air into shapes — and he'd felt something that wasn't quite envy and wasn't quite hunger. It was closer to recognition. The understanding that the thing those men had — the discipline, the purpose, the knowledge that when violence came they would know what to do with their hands — was the thing he'd been drinking to avoid needing.

He'd come back the next day with a wooden training blade he'd found in a refuse pile behind the armoury. It was warped. The grip was cracked. The balance was wrong in a way that made every swing feel like he was trying to hit something with the blunt end of a broom.

He'd kept it anyway. He was still using it. The crack in the grip had widened until he'd wrapped it with a strip of leather cut from an old belt, and the warp had become so familiar that he compensated for it without thinking — dropping his right shoulder on the backswing, over-rotating on the follow-through — in ways that would have made an actual swordsman wince.

He didn't have an actual swordsman. He had the memory of watching soldiers drill, a few corrections shouted at him by a sergeant who'd passed through the yard one morning and taken pity on him, and the stubborn, grinding repetition of a man who knew he was doing it wrong and had no one to show him right.

He set his feet. Squared his shoulders. Breathed.

The training post was a timber sunk into the ground at the yard's centre, about shoulder height, wrapped in rope that had frayed to the point where it was more decoration than padding. The soldiers used it for shield drills. November used it because it didn't judge him, didn't watch him with the flat assessment of men who'd been holding weapons since before he'd learned to hold a cup without shaking.

He swung.

The blade connected — flat, because he'd rolled his wrist again, the same mistake he'd been making for weeks. The impact jarred up his arm and into his shoulder, which was already sore from yesterday's session, which had been sore from the session before that, in a chain of minor damage that never quite healed because he never quite stopped.

He reset. Swung again. Better — edge alignment caught this time, the blade biting into the rope with a sound that was almost correct. Almost the clean, bright crack he heard when the soldiers hit the post and the wood rang like a bell.

His sounded like a man hitting a door with a stick.

He swung again. And again. Working through the forms he'd memorised by watching the morning drills — overhead cut, cross-guard, rising strike, the sweep they called the reaper's arc that was supposed to flow from the hip in a single, fluid motion but which November executed in two distinct, mechanical steps that left him open on the left side every time.

He knew he was open on the left side. He'd been told — the sergeant, that one morning, standing with his arms crossed and his face arranged in the particular expression of a man who was witnessing something that was technically legal but probably shouldn't be.

*You drop your guard when you sweep. Every time. A child with a stick could put you on the ground.*

November had thanked him. The sergeant had looked at him for a long moment — the way you look at a dog that's trying to open a door — and then walked away shaking his head.

November had gone back to the post.

He was still dropping his guard on the sweep. He could feel it — the gap, the window, the half-second where his left side was a gift to anyone fast enough to take it. But his body hadn't learned to close it yet. His mind knew what to do. His arms hadn't received the letter.

Swing. Reset. Swing. The morning air was cold enough that his breath came in clouds, and the sweat along his ribs cooled before it had time to soak through his shirt. His hands ached — the grip was too thin for his fingers, and the leather wrapping had bunched in a way that pressed a ridge of material into his palm with every impact.

He kept going.

This was the part of the morning he didn't talk about. Not because it was sacred or secret, but because there was nothing to say about it that wouldn't sound like either self-pity or self-congratulation, and November had no patience for either. He trained because the alternative was to be the man he'd been before her — the man who woke in other people's blood with no memory of whose it was, who drank until the edges of the world went soft enough that he could stand to look at it, who had been on a path toward a death that would have been unremarkable even by Bloodhollow's generous standards.

The Creed didn't come from a mentor or a scroll or a divine revelation. It came from the bottom of a bottle and the floor of the Hall of the Fallen, where he'd woken one morning with a broken nose and the realisation that he was either going to build something or he was going to die, and that no one was coming to help him choose.

He swung. Hit the post. Felt the impact travel through his bones.

*We are the flame in the night. The wall that does not break.*

He was not the flame. Not yet. He was the man trying to strike the flint.

He trained for an hour. By the end, his arms were shaking, his shoulders burned, and there was a blister forming on his right palm where the leather wrapping had finally worn through. He set the training blade against the post and leaned on it, breathing hard, and stared at the marks he'd left in the rope — shallow cuts, uneven spacing, the record of a man who was trying.

The sky was beginning to lighten. Grey-blue along the eastern wall, the colour of old steel. Somewhere beyond the training yard, the city was stirring — the first forge-fires being lit in the lower ring, the metallic clang of shutters opening on Smelter's Row, the distant rumble of supply carts on the cobblestones heading toward the garrison.

November wiped the sweat from his face with his sleeve and went to find breakfast.

---

The Hall of the Fallen was already awake.

It was always awake, in truth. The building didn't sleep so much as lower its voice — the night shift moving between cots in the dimness, the quiet tending that happened after the surgeries were done and the patients who would live had been separated from those who wouldn't. But morning brought a different energy: the day shift arriving with clean linens and fresh water, the kitchen staff clattering pots in the alcove that passed for a galley, the particular brand of organised chaos that Horus navigated the way a ship navigates current — not fighting it, just knowing where it went.

He found her in the main ward.

She was elbow-deep in a man's shoulder, her sleeves pushed past her elbows, a strand of hair hanging across her face that she kept blowing away with a sharp, upward breath that never quite worked. The patient — a dock worker, by the look of his hands, broad and scarred and callused in the pattern of a man who'd spent years hauling rope — was conscious, which was worse. He was staring at the ceiling with the fixed, deliberate gaze of someone who had decided that whatever was happening below his collarbone was not his concern.

November stood in the doorway and watched.

There was a way Horus held herself when she worked that he had never seen in anyone else. Not calm, exactly — she was too aware for calm, too attuned to the small shifts in a patient's breathing, the twitch of a muscle that said the bone hadn't set right, the particular stillness that meant someone was about to scream. It was closer to focus. The total, consuming attention of a woman who had reduced the world to the space between her hands and acted as though nothing outside that space existed.

Her fingers moved. The man made a sound — short, bitten off. Horus said something to him that November couldn't hear, and the man's jaw unclenched by a fraction, and she went back to work.

She didn't look up. She knew he was there — she always knew, the same way she knew when a patient's fever was about to spike or when the linen supply was running low or when the night shift had skipped the wound checks because they were short-staffed and exhausted. She just didn't stop what she was doing for things that could wait.

November waited.

She finished with the dock worker — tying off the suture with a knot that was small and precise and unreasonably clean given that her hands were covered in the man's blood — and gave him a set of instructions that November caught in fragments. *Don't lift anything heavier than a cup for three days. If the swelling doesn't go down by tomorrow, come back. If the stitches pull, don't try to fix them yourself, I mean it, Dalton, I will find out.*

The man — Dalton — nodded. He tried to sit up and she put a hand on his chest and pushed him flat with a gentleness that was also, unmistakably, an order.

Then she turned.

Her eyes found him. Dark, sharp, the faintest trace of warmth beneath the clinical assessment that was her default expression before her first meal. She blew the strand of hair out of her face — it fell back immediately — and looked him over the way she looked over everyone who walked into the Hall.

"You're bleeding."

November looked down at his hand. The blister had opened. A thin line of red ran across his palm and into the crease between his fingers.

"It's nothing."

"I'll decide what's nothing." She was already moving toward the basin, washing her hands with the quick, thorough efficiency of someone who did it forty times a day. "Sit."

He sat on the edge of an empty cot. She dried her hands, pulled a clean strip of linen from the shelf, and took his hand in hers. Her fingers were still damp. Cool from the water. Steadier than anything he knew.

She turned his palm toward the light and examined the blister with the same expression she'd given the dock worker's shoulder — not concerned, not dismissive, just reading it. Translating the damage into a language she understood better than anyone he'd ever met.

"You're gripping too tight."

"I know."

"You've known for two weeks. Your grip hasn't gotten the message."

He smiled. Couldn't help it. She caught it — the corner of her mouth moved, a small thing, barely there, and then she was wrapping his hand with the linen, her fingers working the strip in quick, overlapping passes that covered the blister without restricting his movement.

"Eat something," she said, tying off the bandage. "You look like a man who's been hitting a piece of wood for an hour."

"I have been hitting a piece of wood for an hour."

"Then you look honest." She let go of his hand. "I saved you the heel."

---

They ate in the alcove behind the linen shelves.

There was a bench there — really just a plank laid across two supply crates — and a narrow window that looked out onto the alley between the Hall and the farrier's shop next door. The window let in a shaft of morning light that fell across the bench at an angle, catching the dust motes that drifted in the air and turning them into something that, if November squinted and was feeling generous, looked almost like the gold leaf illuminations in the cathedral scrolls.

He didn't say that. Horus would have laughed at him, and then she would have looked at the light herself and said something practical about the dust, and then they would have sat in a silence that was better than most people's conversations.

The bread was coarse. Dark. The kind the Hall's kitchen baked in bulk because it was cheap and filling and lasted three days before it went hard enough to use as a weapon. The heel was the dense, curved end piece that most people left because it required actual effort to chew.

November liked it. Horus knew this. She saved it for him every morning without being asked, the way she did a hundred small things without being asked — adjusting the blanket when he slept too close to the edge, leaving a cup of water on the stool beside the cot because she knew he'd wake before her and his throat would be dry, stepping out of his way in the narrow corridor with a timing so precise it must have been unconscious because no one could be that attentive on purpose.

Or maybe she could. Maybe that was what it meant to be Horus.

He tore the heel in half and offered her the larger piece. She took it without comment, bit into it, and chewed with the methodical patience of a woman who had been eating this same bread for long enough that she no longer tasted it.

"How was the post?" she asked.

"Still standing."

"Pity."

He snorted. She took another bite.

"You're still dropping your left side," she said. Not a question.

He looked at her. "You can tell that from a blister?"

"I can tell that from the way you sit. You're favouring your right shoulder. You over-rotate on the sweep, your body compensates by tightening the right side, your grip adjusts, and you get a blister." She gestured at his wrapped hand. "Your swordwork has a blister. That's the blister."

"You've thought about this."

"I've watched you limp in here every morning for three months. I've had time."

There was something in the way she said it — not reproach, not worry, just the plain statement of a woman who observed everything and said only what was necessary. She didn't ask him to stop training. She didn't tell him he was wasting his time or that the soldiers who did this for a living were better at it than he would ever be. She knew both of those things. He knew she knew them. The fact that neither of them said it was a kindness they extended to each other like the heel of the bread — small, understood, requiring no acknowledgment.

"I'll work on it," he said.

"You'll work on it the same way you've been working on it. Badly and stubbornly and at an hour when no one is awake to see."

"That's the plan."

"It's a terrible plan."

"It's my plan."

She looked at him. The clinical assessment was gone — or rather, it was still there, but beneath it was something warmer. Something that she kept banked most of the time, like a forge fire that was never allowed to burn high but never allowed to go out. The look she gave him when the work was done and the patients were sleeping and the Hall had lowered its voice to a murmur, and it was just the two of them in the alcove with the bad bread and the thin light and the silence that held everything they didn't need to say.

"Tell me about the Creed," she said.

She'd heard it before. Many times. She asked anyway — not because she wanted to hear the words but because she knew what it meant to him to say them. The same way she changed his bandages and saved the heel and let him sleep on the side of the cot closest to the wall: because she had learned the shape of him and had decided it was a shape worth tending.

November set down the bread. Brushed the crumbs from his hands. Looked at the light coming through the window — the gold dust, the farrier's wall, the ordinary miracle of a morning that existed.

"We do not cheat," he said. Quietly. The way he always said it — not as a recitation, but as a promise being renewed. "We do not lie. We do not abandon."

She listened. Her eyes were on him and they were warm and she was not smiling but she was something better than smiling — she was present, fully, the way she was present with a patient or a wound or a choice that mattered.

"Should death come seeking, we will not flinch — but neither will we seek it. We fight so that those who cannot defend themselves have a defender."

He paused. The words sat in the air between them like something held in cupped hands.

"We are the flame in the night. The wall that does not break. We are the last line."

The silence after was the best silence he knew. Not empty — full. Full of the fact that he had said the truest thing he owned to the person who had taught him he was allowed to own it, and that she had heard it, and that hearing it was enough.

Horus reached across and took the other half of the bread from his hand. She bit into it. Chewed. Swallowed.

"You missed your left side again this morning," she said.

He laughed. It came from somewhere deep — the real place, the one the bottle had almost drowned, the one she had found when she looked at him on the floor of the Hall and decided he was worth the bandages.

She did not laugh with him. She did something better. She leaned her shoulder against his — a small pressure, brief, the contact of a woman who expressed affection the way she expressed everything else: precisely, deliberately, and only when she meant it.

The light moved across the bench. The dust drifted. Somewhere in the Hall, a patient called for water and a healer answered, and the day began the way days do in places where the wounded outnumber the whole — quietly, relentlessly, one task at a time.

November finished his bread. Horus finished hers.

---

He walked the Hall with her after that.

Not because she needed him — she moved through the wards with the sureness of a woman who had mapped every cot, every supply cabinet, every squeaking floorboard in her first week and had never consulted the map since. She didn't need an escort. She didn't need protection. What she needed was a pair of hands that could lift a man who was too heavy for her to turn alone, and a presence that wouldn't get in the way, and November had spent three months learning to be both of those things.

He held a soldier's arm while she re-splinted it. The man was young — younger than November, maybe twenty — and he was trying very hard not to make a sound, the way soldiers did, as if pain were a private failing rather than a fact of anatomy. His jaw was locked and his eyes were wet and his free hand was gripping the cot frame hard enough to turn his knuckles white.

"Breathe," Horus told him.

The soldier breathed. A ragged, wet sound.

"Again."

He breathed again. Horus set the bone. There was a click — the specific, intimate sound of things going back where they belonged — and the soldier exhaled a word that was probably a prayer and possibly a curse and was, in the end, just the noise a man makes when the worst part is over and his body finally believes it.

Horus tied off the splint. Checked the colour of his fingers. Satisfied, she moved to the next cot.

November followed.

They did this through the morning — moving bed to bed, patient to patient, the small, necessary work of keeping people alive in a city that was running short of reasons to bother. Horus worked. November helped. He fetched water when the pitchers ran dry. He stripped soiled linens and carried them to the wash tubs in the courtyard. He sat with a woman whose husband had died in the night and who wasn't ready to be alone yet and who needed someone to be in the room while she figured out what the rest of her life was going to look like.

He didn't say anything to the woman. He didn't need to. He sat on the stool beside her cot and she stared at the wall and the morning light crept across the floor, and when she finally spoke — a single word, her husband's name, said to no one — November said, "I'm sorry," and meant it with every part of himself that still knew what loss tasted like.

Horus found him there.

She stood in the doorway and watched him the way he had watched her earlier — not interrupting, not intruding, just seeing. Then she moved on to the next patient, and November sat with the widow until the woman's sister arrived, and by the time he left the room the morning was half gone and the light through the Hall's windows had shifted from gold to the flat, white glare of midday.

He found Horus at the wash basin, scrubbing her hands.

"Thank you," she said. She didn't specify for what. She didn't need to.

"I didn't do anything."

"You sat with her."

"Anyone could have sat with her."

Horus turned off the water. Dried her hands on a cloth that had been white once and was now the colour of tea. She looked at him with an expression that he had learned, over months of study, was the one she wore when she wanted to say something she considered important and was deciding whether he was ready to hear it.

"Anyone could have," she said. "You did."

She hung the cloth on its hook. Blew the hair out of her face. It fell back.

"Your left side is still open, by the way. I saw you through the window."

"You were watching me train?"

"I was checking whether the shutters need replacing. You happened to be in the way." She paused. "Fix your sweep."

She walked back into the ward. November watched her go — the straight back, the efficient stride, the way she moved through the Hall like she was the only fixed point and everything else arranged itself around her.

He stood there for a moment. Just a moment. Long enough to feel the weight of the morning settle into his bones — the bread, the light, the sound of her voice saying his name to the empty air between them. Long enough to check the compass.

*Am I living the Creed?*

He thought about the training post. The blister. The dropped guard. The gap between who he was and who the Creed described.

He thought about the widow. The soldier with the broken arm. The way Horus's shoulder had pressed against his, briefly, like a door opening and closing in the same breath.

He thought about the man he'd been — the floor of a tavern, the taste of blood and bad ale, the slow spiral toward a death that would have been as unremarkable as a candle going out in a room no one was watching.

He was not the man the Creed described. Not yet. Not close.

But he was closer than yesterday.

*Standing. Sober. Useful. Loved.*

He could hear her in the ward, giving instructions to the day shift in the clipped, certain tone that meant the morning rush was starting and there would be no room for hesitation until evening. The Hall breathed around him — the coughing man, the creak of cots, the quiet industry of a place that existed because the world kept breaking people and someone had to put them back together.

November flexed his bandaged hand. The blister stung.

He went back to the training yard.

The post was waiting. The morning was good. The light was the colour of old steel and the air tasted like forge smoke and the woman he loved was forty paces away, elbow-deep in someone's wound, blowing hair out of her face.

He picked up the training blade. Set his feet. Squared his shoulders.

Dropped his guard on the left side.

Swore. Reset.

Tried again.
