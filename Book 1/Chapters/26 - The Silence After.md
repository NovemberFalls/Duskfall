# Chapter 26 — THE SILENCE AFTER

## Day 6 — After

---

The fighting stopped the way a heart stopped — not all at once but in stages, each beat weaker than the last, each contraction a diminished version of the one before, until the rhythm that had been constant for six days simply was not there anymore and the absence was a sound louder than anything the siege had produced.

November heard it in pieces.

The first piece was the retreat. The orcs pulling back — not the disciplined withdrawal of formations but the fragmented, scattered movement of warbands that had lost the thing holding them together. He saw them from the avenue south of the blown barricade: dark shapes moving north through the smoke, the armoured bodies withdrawing through the rubble they had charged through minutes before, the forward momentum reversed, the tide going out. They were not running. Running implied panic, and the orcs did not panic. They were leaving, with the specific, heavy gait of warriors who had been told to stop and were stopping because the voice that had told them to fight was silent and the silence was the only order they understood.

The second piece was the sound. Or the absence of it. The bone horns stopped. The war-cries stopped. The percussion of combat — the shields, the steel, the impact of bodies hitting bodies — thinned and thinned and then was gone, the way the last embers of a fire were gone, not extinguished but consumed, the fuel that had sustained them spent.

The third piece was the breathing. His own. The ragged, wet sound of a man whose lungs were working through damage that had been accumulating for six days and whose ribs had been renegotiating their arrangement with every breath since Day 1. He could hear himself breathing because there was nothing else to hear. The smoke drifted. The rain had stopped at some point — he didn't know when, the transition from rain to not-rain lost in the fighting the way everything was lost in the fighting. The sky was the same wrong colour it had been for six days, amber and grey and bruised, the sky of a city that had been burning since the first barrage and would burn for days more because fires did not stop when the men who set them stopped.

He stood in the avenue.

Darya's sword was in his right hand. The grip was slippery — blood and rain and the seepage from the blisters that had been blisters that had been calluses that had been blisters again, the skin beneath the leather gone through so many iterations of damage and repair that it was no longer skin in any useful sense but a surface, raw and weeping, that held the sword because the muscles behind it had forgotten how to let go.

Around him: the aftermath.

The dormitory avenue. The space between the blown barricade and the courtyard where Stoneveil had fought the Warlord. The ground was rubble and bodies — human, orc, the dead lying where the fighting had placed them, the dead arranged in the random, intimate geometry of a battlefield where the distances between combatants had been measured in feet and the falling had placed them beside each other and on top of each other and in the spaces between each other, the proximity of death erasing the distance that life had maintained.

Tesswin was alive. November could see her — twenty paces south, at the edge of the courtyard, her spear braced against the cobblestones, her body in the particular, locked stance of a soldier who had stopped fighting but had not yet received the information that she could stop standing. Her face was a mask of dust and blood. Her eyes were open but were looking at something that was not in the courtyard, not in the avenue, not in the district — something behind the surface of her eyes, in the place where the six days lived, in the room that would hold them for however long the holding lasted.

Two others. The composite soldier — the man whose name November had never learned, who had fought beside him at the barricade for forty minutes and then in the avenue for however long the avenue fight had taken, the man whose face was a wound and whose shield arm hung at an angle that said the arm was no longer connected to the shoulder in the way arms were supposed to be connected to shoulders. He was sitting against the dormitory wall, his legs extended, his good hand pressed against his thigh where something was leaking steadily through his fingers.

And the boy. The runner. Fifteen years old, the arrow still in his shoulder, sitting where he had been sitting when the fighting was at the barricade, against the building wall, his eyes the same enormous circles they had been when the fighting started. He had not moved. The world had fought and bled and died around him and he had not moved because moving required a set of instructions his body had stopped processing when the arrow entered his shoulder and the processing had not resumed.

Four. With November, five.

Five from the thirteen who had held the barricade. Five from the eighteen in Rath's composite unit. Five from the eight hundred and fifty who had stood on the walls on Day 1.

The numbers pressed against the inside of November's ribs the way the bruising pressed — from the inside out, a pressure that was not pain but weight, the specific, accumulating weight of subtraction, of the count going down, of the world growing smaller one body at a time.

He looked north. Through the avenue, through the smoke, through the rubble of the blown barricade. The orcs were gone. The shapes that had been advancing, climbing, fighting, dying — the shapes that had been the enemy for six days and the reason for the wall and the reason for the sword and the reason for every wound on his body — were gone. The avenue was empty except for the dead and the dead were no longer advancing.

He looked south. The courtyard. The gate to the Inner Ring. A body on the cobblestones — massive, armoured, the boar-tusk pauldrons visible even at this distance, the shape that had been a Warlord lying in the specific, forward-facing position of a man who had died facing the thing he had been walking toward.

Stoneveil was in the courtyard. November could see him — a figure standing near the body, standing the way Tesswin was standing, the locked stance, the body vertical through force of will rather than function. The Warden's left arm hung. His sword was in his right hand. He was not moving.

No one was moving.

The silence settled. Not the silence of peace — peace implied resolution, and there was no resolution in the avenue or the courtyard or the district or the city. This was the silence of exhaustion. The silence of a thing that had been making noise for six days and had used up all the noise it had and was left with the space where the noise had been, the empty space, the ringing absence that sat in the ears the way the blast had sat on Day 1.

The ringing.

November realised it was in his ears. Not the external silence — the internal one, the tinnitus from the barricade blast, the same frequency that had been with him since Day 1 when the first detonation took Horus and took his hearing and took the world and replaced it with smoke and screaming. The ringing was louder now. Or the world was quieter. The two were the same thing — the ringing was the sound the silence made when the silence was absolute, the frequency of absence, the note that played when everything else stopped.

He stood in the ringing.

The compass stirred.

---

*Standing?*

He was standing. In the avenue. In the rubble. In the ruins of a district that had been destroyed three times — the firebombing, the siege, the final assault — and was still on fire in places, the flames feeding on whatever the buildings had left to give, the small, persistent fires that no one would put out because the people who put out fires were dead or standing in the rubble beside him with the same expression on their faces, the expression that was not victory and not grief and not relief but the compound of all three mixed with something else, something that had no name because the naming required a distance from the thing that they did not yet have.

*Sober?*

The word arrived from the inner chamber and the word was absurd and the absurdity was the point. Sober. The compass did not ask questions that were complicated. The compass asked questions that were foundational — the bedrock questions, the ones that said *are you still the man who climbed out of the bottle, are you still the man who chose the Creed, are you still the man who stood on the wall.* The bottle was so far away it belonged to a different person in a different world, a world where mornings existed and bread had heels and a woman saved the heel for a man who gripped too tight.

*The Creed?*

We do not abandon.

The words arrived. They did not ring the way they had rung on Day 2, when the Creed had been a thing he was testing. They did not ring the way they had rung on Day 4, when the Creed had been a thing he was proving. They rang the way a bell rang after it had been struck too many times — with the accumulated resonance of every striking, each one adding to the vibration, the bell becoming the sound instead of producing it.

He had not abandoned Edric Thane. He had held his hand while the hand went cold and the holding was the Creed made weight, the Creed made flesh, the Creed made real in the space between two men in the rubble of a barricade while the war took the one and left the other.

He had not abandoned Tesswin or the composite soldiers or the boy with the arrow. He had stood in the line and held the avenue and fought with the same artless, desperate, ugly violence that had been his contribution since Day 2 — the worst fighter on every wall, the man who swung late and hit wrong and went down and got up, and got up, and got up.

He had not abandoned.

*Did I live the Creed?*

The answer was the same answer it had been every time the compass asked. Not clean. Not simple. The answer was Edric's closed eyes and the soldiers who died at Position Seven and the defenders ahead of him on Day 5 who might have lived if he had gone to them instead of the civilians. The answer was every choice that had a cost and every cost that was paid by someone who did not choose to pay it.

The answer was: he was standing.

The compass settled. The needle pointed. Not at the avenue or the courtyard or the gate. The needle pointed at the thing it had been pointing at since Day 1, the thing that had driven every step and every swing and every time the ground received him and the compass said *get up.* The needle pointed at the absence. The void shaped like a woman with dark, sharp eyes who saved the heel of the bread and diagnosed his swordwork from a blister and whose fingers were steadier than anything he had ever known.

*Horus.*

The name arrived in the inner chamber and the chamber rang with it.

November lowered Darya's sword.

He did not let go of the grip. The muscles would not allow it — the locked, convulsive hold that had been permanent since Day 3, the body's last remaining certainty: hold the weapon. But he lowered the blade until the point touched the cobblestones, the steel resting against the stone, the weight of the sword transferred from his arm to the ground.

He turned north.

---

The search began the way everything in the siege had begun — with a step. One step. Then another. The body that had been operational past the point where operational had meaning finding the mechanical sequence of walking and performing it the way it performed everything now: through residue, through fumes, through the last reserves of a system that had spent everything and was running on the accumulated stubbornness of a man who had made a decision on Day 1 and had not yet found a reason to unmake it.

He walked north through the avenue.

Past the blown barricade. Past the rubble that had been Dorran's basalt. Past the bodies that lay in the positions the fighting had arranged them — the orc with the heavy sword who had killed Edric, lying face-down in the rubble with Tesswin's spear still through his chest; the auxiliaries from the barricade, buried under the stone the blast had scattered; the Legionnaire with the bandaged skull, slumped against the basalt, his sword still in his hand, the bandage dark with what was underneath it.

Past Edric.

November stopped.

The body was where he had left it. Against the basalt block. The armour that had been battered into a shape that fit. The crimson sash that had been black since Day 3. The sword still in his side — the hilt protruding from below the ribs, the weapon that had ended him still marking the place. His hands were on his chest, where November had placed them. His eyes were closed, where November had closed them.

He looked young.

The thought arrived without invitation and the thought was wrong — Edric had not looked young since Day 3, since the forge sound, since the day the boy had become the man. But death had done something to the face. Death had taken the tension out of the jaw and the set out of the brow and the focus out of the features, and what remained was the face beneath the face, the nineteen years, the boy who had been afraid and willing and who had said *I'll be beside you* and had been.

November knelt.

His ribs protested. His left arm — the arm that had been strapped to his side since Day 1, the arm he had forgotten was an arm because it had been a weight and a liability and a dead thing for six days — hung at an angle. His right arm held the sword point-down against the cobblestones, the blade a crutch, the weapon performing the last function it would perform for the man who held it: holding him up while he knelt beside the boy he could not save.

"I'll find your mother," he said. "And your sisters."

The words were for the silence. For the ringing. For the thing behind Edric's closed eyes that had gone somewhere else and might or might not be able to hear the things said to the face it had left behind. November did not know if the dead heard. He did not know if the silence that Kael prayed into had ears on the other side. He knew that the compass said the words should be said and the saying was not for the dead but for the man saying them — the promise made aloud because promises made aloud carried weight that promises made in the inner chamber did not, and the weight was how you knew the promise was real.

"I'll tell Kael."

The unfinished sentence. The thing Edric had tried to say before the breath came in and did not go out. *Tell Kael I—*

November did not know how the sentence ended. He would carry the incompletion. The Creed did not require him to invent the ending — the Creed required him to deliver what was given, and what was given was *tell Kael I—* and the dash was part of the message and the dash was the cost.

He stood. The standing was harder each time — not because the body was weaker, though the body was weaker, but because the standing required leaving and leaving required letting go and letting go was the thing the compass did not know how to do.

He walked north.

---

The Anvil District was a graveyard.

Not a metaphor. The district had become, literally and structurally, a place for the dead. They lay in the streets and the alleys and the doorways and the rubble. They lay where the barricades had been, in the positions the fighting had arranged, in the specific, intimate postures that said this one had died fighting and this one had died running and this one had died standing and this one had died on his knees with his hands pressed against a wound that the pressing could not close.

Human. Orc. The dead did not sort themselves by faction. The dead lay beside each other in the indiscriminate proximity of bodies that had stopped caring about the distinctions that the living maintained — the walls, the sides, the reasons. A human soldier and an orc warrior lay tangled at a junction, their weapons still in each other, the killing mutual and simultaneous, the two of them locked in the embrace that combat produced when combat was close enough and final enough and the dying happened to both at once.

November walked through them.

He searched.

Not methodically — he did not have the capacity for method. Method required a system and a system required a mind that could organise and his mind was past organising, past sorting, past the cognitive function that produced categories and sequences and plans. His mind was doing one thing: looking. The eyes moved over every face. Every body. Every shape in the rubble that might have been a person and was a person and was not the person.

He was looking for her.

The looking had been the engine since Day 1. The engine that drove him out of the rubble after the blast. The engine that drove him to the composite unit. The engine that kept him on the wall when the wall was killing everyone who stood on it. The engine was not hope — hope was a word for people who had the luxury of probability, and probability had been a stranger since the blast. The engine was refusal. The refusal to accept that the absence was permanent. The refusal to stop looking until the looking produced an answer, and the answer — any answer, even the worst answer — was better than the absence, because the absence was a question and the question was the thing that was killing him more slowly and more thoroughly than any orc sword.

He checked the faces of the dead.

Human faces. Orc faces. The faces that death made similar in the way death made everything similar — the slack muscles, the open mouths, the eyes that were open and seeing nothing or closed and seeing nothing, the distinction between open and closed irrelevant because the seeing had stopped and the stopping was the same.

He checked the survivors.

There were people in the rubble. Alive. Wounded. Sitting or lying or crouching in the spaces between the fighting's wreckage, the people who had been inside buildings or behind walls or under the stone when the worst of it passed over them. Civilians — the ones November had fought for on Day 5, the ones who had been in the dormitories when the barricade held, the ones whose survival was the thing the barricade had purchased at the cost of everyone who stood behind it.

He checked their faces. Women. Men. Children. The faces of people who had been hiding for six days and were emerging into a silence they did not yet trust, their eyes carrying the particular expression of people who had heard the fighting stop and were not yet sure it had stopped or if the stopping was another kind of beginning.

None of them were her.

He walked north. Through the Anvil. Past Blackhand's forge — the burned-out shell that Stoneveil had used as a command post, the building that had died twice, the anvil inside still standing because anvils were the last thing to fall. Past the positions that had been barricades and were rubble. Past the intersections where the fighting had been the worst and the dead were the most numerous and the faces were the most damaged and the checking was the most difficult because some faces were not faces anymore, the violence having done to the features what the violence did to everything: destroyed the specificity, erased the identity, turned the particular into the general.

He checked anyway.

The checking was a process. Not a thought — a function, a mechanical action the body performed the way it performed breathing and walking and the grip on the sword. He would stop. He would kneel — if the body permitted kneeling, and sometimes it did not, and sometimes he bent at the waist and looked down and the looking down was a compromise between the need to see and the body's refusal to fold any further. He would look at the face. He would find a woman's face or a woman's shape in the rubble and the finding would produce a moment — a fraction of a second, a heartbeat, a contraction in his chest — where the compass flared and the needle spun and the possibility existed that the next face would be her face.

It never was.

He moved through the outer positions. The converted forge-shops. The rubble of Position Two, where the northern barricade had been, where Rath's unit had fought on Day 5. The avenue where November had fought three orcs with a broken sword and killed one with the stump. He checked the dead here too — the faces, the bodies, the shapes. The dead were thicker here. The outer positions had been overrun on Day 6's dawn and the overrunning had been complete, the orc assault washing through the barricades and the buildings with the force of something that was finishing what it had started, and the finishing had left bodies in the densities that finishing produced.

He searched the Hall of the Fallen.

What was left of it. The building had taken a direct hit on Day 1 — the first barrage, the blast that had taken Horus, the detonation that had started everything. Six days of siege had finished what the blast had started. The roof was gone. The walls stood in fragments — the eastern wall intact to the height of a man, the western wall collapsed, the northern wall a pile of rubble that had been a pile of rubble since Day 1 and had accumulated more rubble since because the siege had used the ruins as raw material for the fighting that happened around and through and on top of it.

November stood in the entrance.

The entrance that had been an entrance. The doorway was there — the frame, the stone lintel, the wooden door splintered off its hinges and lying in the rubble inside. He had walked through this door a thousand times. A thousand mornings. The early morning, before the Hall woke, when he would slip out without disturbing her and walk to the training yard and hit the post and come back with a blister and she would wrap it and tell him he was gripping too tight.

Too tight. The same mistake.

He stepped inside.

The main ward was rubble. The cots were broken — the wooden frames splintered, the linens torn and buried, the neat rows that had been patients and blankets and the organised machinery of a place that healed people scattered across the floor in the random geometry of a blast. The surgical station where she had worked on the dock worker — Dalton, his name was Dalton — was a pile of stone and wood and the iron instruments that had been her tools, the forceps and the needles and the scissors lying in the debris like the bones of an animal that had been disassembled.

He moved through the ward.

Checking. The same function. The mechanical process that had carried him through the district, through the dead, through every face that was not her face. He checked the bodies in the Hall — three, four, the patients who had been in the cots when the blast hit, the wounded who had come to be healed and had been killed by the same violence they had been wounded by, the specific, grinding cruelty of a world that destroyed the places that fixed what the destroying broke.

None of them were her.

He reached the alcove behind the linen shelves.

The shelves were down. The linens scattered. The narrow space that had been their place — the bench, the crates, the window — was compressed under the collapsed wall, the stones and timber filling the space the way the rubble filled everything, completely, leaving no room for the things that had been there.

The window was broken. The shaft of morning light that had caught the dust motes and turned them into something that looked like gold — the light was not there. The window was a hole in the wall and the hole showed the alley and the alley showed the sky and the sky was amber and grey and had nothing to offer.

He stood in the alcove.

The cot was under the rubble. He could see the edge of it — the wooden frame, the corner post, the piece of furniture that had held them both in its narrow, complaining space. He remembered the way she slept — on her left side, her fingers hooked into his sleeve, the grip that was not a grip but a contact, the touch that said *I know you're here and the knowing is enough.*

He could not breathe.

The compression was not physical — or it was physical, the ribs and the bruising and the six days of damage, but it was also the other thing, the thing that lived in the chest beside the compass, the thing that was shaped like her absence and was expanding, pressing outward against the ribs from the inside, the same pressure that had been there since Day 1 but larger now, filling the space, the pressure that was not pain because pain was a sensation and this was a condition, a state, the state of a chest that contained a cavity where something had been and the something was gone.

She was not in the Hall.

She was not among the dead in the Hall.

She was not among the dead in the streets.

She was not among the survivors in the dormitories.

She was not among the wounded being carried south through the service corridor that Stoneveil had ordered opened.

She was not.

---

November searched for two hours.

He searched the way he had fought — badly, stubbornly, without method or grace, the body moving through the district in a pattern that was not a pattern but a compulsion, the feet carrying him to every place he had been with her and every place she might have been taken and every place a wounded woman might have crawled or been dragged or been carried by the chaos that had consumed the city on Day 1 and had not released it for six days.

He checked the triage stations. The improvised aid posts that the surgeons had set up in the buildings near the walls — the converted forge-shops and dormitories and cellars where the wounded were brought and the bringing was measured in how many minutes they had and the minutes determined whether they received a surgeon's hands or a priest's prayer or nothing, the nothing that was most common because the nothing was what happened when the wounded outnumbered the hands and the hands were fewer each day.

He checked the mass graves. The trenches that Stoneveil's engineers had dug on Day 3 when the dead outnumbered the space to hold them — the long, shallow cuts in the earth behind the barricades where the bodies were placed, row on row, the faces covered with whatever was available because covering the faces was the last dignity the garrison could afford and the affording was expensive and the covering was thin.

He pulled back the coverings. Checked the faces. Human faces. Women's faces. Faces that were not her face, each one a small, specific relief that was also a small, specific horror — the relief that the face was not hers, the horror that the face was someone's, the knowledge that every face he checked and dismissed was a person whose absence would devastate someone the way her absence was devastating him, and the someone would search the way he was searching and the searching would produce the same result or a different result and neither result was good because the finding was grief and the not-finding was the thing that was worse than grief.

He checked the service corridor beneath the eastern wall. The passage that Stoneveil had ordered opened — the narrow, stone-walled tunnel that led from the Anvil District to the Inner Ring, the passage that the wounded and the civilians had been pushed through in the final hour. The corridor was empty now. The pushing was done. The people who had been pushed were on the other side, behind the gate, in the Inner Ring where the Ironbound Guard stood with their polished halberds and their immaculate armour and their six days of standing behind a closed door while the city died outside it.

She was not in the corridor.

He emerged from the tunnel into the light — the wrong light, the amber light, the light that had been wrong for six days. He stood at the edge of the courtyard where the Warlord's body lay on the cobblestones and Stoneveil stood beside it and the silence was the silence of a thing that was finished and the finishing was a weight that sat on the courtyard like weather.

He looked at Stoneveil.

The Warden did not look at him. The Warden was looking at the body at his feet. The Warden was looking at the Warlord's face with the expression that November had seen on his own face when he closed Edric's eyes — the expression of a man who had done a thing that was necessary and was standing in the wreckage of the necessity and was discovering that necessity did not make the wreckage smaller.

November turned away.

He walked back into the Anvil.

---

She was not in the Anvil District.

She was not among the seventy-two survivors whose count was being tallied by a woman with a slate and a stub of chalk — Captain Veyne, whose name November had heard but whose face he had not registered, a woman who was moving through the district with the mechanical precision of a person whose function was counting and the counting was the last function she could perform and the performing was the only thing between her and the space where the counting stopped and the silence began.

She was not among the four hundred and eleven dead whose bodies were being gathered by the survivors who could still walk — the slow, terrible work of a district being sorted, the living separated from the dead, the dead separated from the rubble, the rubble left where it was because the rubble was the district and the district was the rubble and the separating was only for the things that had been people.

She was not among the wounded being treated in the courtyard by the two remaining surgeons whose hands were shaking from exhaustion and whose supplies had run out on Day 4 and who were stitching wounds with thread pulled from uniform hems and packing injuries with linens torn from the dead because the linens from the living were in use and the using was the only option and the option was what happened when a city of eight hundred and fifty became a city of seventy-two and the seventy-two needed more than the seventy-two could provide.

She was not there.

November stood in the centre of the Anvil District. In the street where Forge Road met the junction that had been a market and was a field of rubble. The fires around him were dying — the small, persistent flames losing their fuel, the buildings surrendering the last of what they had to give, the burning slowing the way everything was slowing, the city's violence spending itself out the way the siege's violence had spent itself out, in diminishing returns, in decreasing intensity, in the slow, exhausted taper of a thing that had been too much for too long and was finally, finally becoming less.

He lowered himself to the cobblestones.

Not falling. Not collapsing. The controlled descent of a body that had been standing for six days and was choosing to stop standing — not because the compass said to stop, but because the standing had served its purpose and the purpose was finished and the finishing required a different posture.

He sat in the street.

Darya's sword lay across his knees. The blade was dark — the residue of six days of use, the iron of the blood bonding with the iron of the steel, the surface that had been a weapon accumulating the record of what it had done in layers of oxidation that would never come clean because the cleaning would remove the record and the record was all that remained of the people the weapon had touched.

His right hand rested on the grip. Too tight. Still too tight. She had told him. Three months of mornings, she had told him. *You're gripping too tight.* And he had gripped too tight anyway, because the gripping was the only way he knew, the only mechanism the hands possessed, the hold that was too much because too much was better than not enough and not enough was the thing that had killed Edric and the soldiers at the barricade and the people he could not reach and the woman he could not find.

Too tight. The same mistake.

He would make it for the rest of his life.

---

The compass spoke one more time.

Not in words — in direction. The needle settling, the mechanism doing what mechanisms did: pointing. The compass pointed north. Not at the orc retreat, not at the hills beyond the city, not at the battlefield that stretched from the walls to the horizon. The compass pointed at the absence. At the void that was shaped like Horus and that no amount of searching had filled and that the not-filling was the answer to a question he had not asked because the asking required accepting the answer and the accepting was the thing he could not do.

She was gone.

Not dead — the word was not dead, the compass did not point at dead, the dead were in the streets and in the trenches and under the rubble and she was not among them. He had checked. He had checked every face and every body and every shape in the rubble that might have been a woman of her height and her build and her way of lying that was different from the way other people lay because she slept on her left side with her fingers hooked into his sleeve.

She was not among the dead.

She was not among the living.

She was gone. The way smoke was gone — not destroyed, dispersed. Carried by the blast, by the chaos, by the six days of violence that had rearranged everything in the city and had rearranged her out of it, out of the places he could search, out of the spaces he could reach, out of the world he could touch with his hands that were bleeding and broken and still gripping too tight.

The absence was not an answer. The absence was a question. The question was: *where?*

The question would drive him for however long the driving lasted. The question would carry him out of the Anvil and into the service and through the machine and across Bloodhollow and into whatever places the searching required. The question was the engine. The question had always been the engine. From the moment the blast hit and the smoke cleared and the place where she had been was empty, the question had been driving him, and the question would not stop driving him because the question did not have a mechanism for stopping.

*Where is she?*

The compass pointed.

November sat in the ruins of the Anvil District and felt the hollowness.

It was not like grief. He had felt grief — for his father, for his mother, for the brother who was presumed dead and whose presumption was a door cracked open that November had never been able to close. Grief was an answer. Grief was the mind's response to a loss that was confirmed, a mechanism that processed the reality of absence and produced the emotions that absence required — the sorrow, the anger, the slow, grinding work of acceptance.

This was not grief. This was the thing before grief, the thing that existed in the space where grief could not form because grief required certainty and certainty was the one thing the absence did not provide. She might be alive. She might be dead. She might be wounded somewhere he could not reach, in a building he did not search, under rubble he did not move. She might have been taken — by the chaos, by the retreat, by the mass of fleeing bodies that the blast had produced on Day 1 when the gates closed and the city divided into inside and outside and the dividing had caught her on one side and him on the other.

She might be anywhere.

The anywhere was the worst part. The anywhere was the thing that sat in his chest and pressed outward and would not resolve into grief because grief required a body and a body required finding and the finding was the thing the two hours of searching had not produced. The anywhere was the ringing in his ears — the tinnitus, the frequency of absence, the sound that played when the world was silent and the silence was the loudest thing.

He sat with it.

The way he had sat with Edric. The way he had sat with Darya. The way she had taught him to sit — with the weight of the thing, without trying to make it smaller, without the instinct to fix that drove other people to fill the silence with words that meant nothing and weighed less. He sat with the hollowness and the hollowness sat with him and the sitting was not comfort and not resolution and not acceptance. The sitting was presence. The last thing he had. The thing the compass could always point at: *be here. In the wreckage. In the silence. Be here.*

He was here.

Seventy-two survivors. A city held. A wall unbroken. A Creed kept.

And she was gone.

---

The light changed.

Not the colour — the angle. The sun was moving behind the smoke, the day progressing the way days progressed regardless of what happened beneath them, the indifferent mechanics of a world that did not pause for sieges or searches or the hollowness of a man sitting in the rubble with a sword across his knees. The angle said afternoon. The angle said the day was half done and the half that remained would bring twilight and then dark and the dark would be the first dark in six days that did not contain the sound of fighting.

November looked at his hands.

His right hand on the grip of Darya's sword. The skin was raw — the blisters broken, the blood dried, the surface of the palm a landscape of damage that mapped the six days in the language of flesh. The callus between thumb and forefinger — the one she had diagnosed from a blister, the one that said *you're gripping too tight* — was gone. The callus had been worn through by the grip and the grip had been worn through by the fighting and what remained was a surface that was neither callus nor blister but something else, a new thing, the tissue that formed when the old tissue was destroyed and the body built something different in its place because the body did not stop building.

His left hand. Still strapped to his side. The arm that had been useless since Day 1, since the blast, since the concussive force had done something to the shoulder that no one had examined because the examining required a healer and the healers were dead or gone and the gone was her. The arm was not an arm. It was a weight. A reminder. The physical manifestation of the blast's cost, the body's record of the moment the siege began.

He looked at the sky. Still wrong. Still amber and grey and bruised. But the wrongness was different now — not the wrongness of a city under siege but the wrongness of a city that had survived one, the specific, damaged sky of a place that had burned for six days and was still burning in places and would burn until the fires ran out of things to burn and the running out would take days more and the days would be days without fighting and the days without fighting would be days of silence and the silence would be the thing that replaced the noise.

Somewhere in the district, a sound. A voice. Not shouting — speaking. The voice of a survivor talking to another survivor, the first voluntary human sound since the fighting stopped, the first sound that was not a command or a report or a scream but a person talking because talking was what people did when the dying stopped and the living began and the living required sound because silence was for the dead and the living were not dead yet.

November listened.

He could not make out the words. The ringing was still there — the tinnitus, the frequency, the sound of the absence. But beneath the ringing, the voice. A sound. A beginning.

He looked down at the sword across his knees.

Darya's sword. The weapon of a woman who had died in the street fighting on Day 5, whose name he knew and whose face he remembered and whose efficiency with a blade had been a thing of beauty in the ugliness. He had carried her sword for two days. He had killed with it and been cut with it and held it while Edric died and held it while the barricade blew and held it while the avenue fought and held it while the silence came.

He would carry it longer.

Not because the sword was special. Not because Darya's memory required it. Because the carrying was what he did — the carrying of the things the dead left behind, the weight of the names and the promises and the unfinished sentences. *Tell Kael I—*

He would carry the dash.

November sat in the ruins of the Anvil District as the light changed and the fires dimmed and the silence deepened and the seventy-two survivors of the garrison of Emberfall moved through the wreckage around him, counting the dead and sorting the rubble and beginning the work that began when the war ended, the work that was not reconstruction but inventory, the measuring of what was left against what had been, the arithmetic of survival that produced a number — seventy-two — and the number was carved into the silence the way the dead were carved into the rubble and the rubble was carved into the district and the district was carved into the city and the city was carved into the continent and the continent was Bloodhollow and Bloodhollow was the place where gods had left and people remained and the remaining was the thing that cost the most and was worth the least and was all there was.

He would find her.

The compass said so. The compass did not have a mechanism for stopping. The compass pointed north, where the orcs had retreated, where the hills rose above the city, where the world extended past the walls into the vast, hostile, broken landscape of a continent that was trying to kill everything on it. Somewhere in that landscape, Horus was alive. She had to be alive. The alternative was grief, and grief required certainty, and the one gift the absence gave him was the absence of certainty, the door cracked open the way the door for his brother was cracked open, the crack that let in just enough light to keep the compass pointing.

She was out there.

He had to believe that.

He did believe that.

The believing was not hope. Hope was for people with evidence. The believing was the Creed — *we do not abandon* — applied to the one person the Creed had always been about, the woman who had shown him that fixing was possible and who had fixed nothing because he had fixed himself but who had stood in the room while the fixing happened and the standing was the thing and the thing was what he was going to find.

He would walk into whatever the world required. Through the machine. Through the service. Through the ranks and the orders and the deployments and the operations. He would become the soldier the machine needed because the machine had reach and the reach was the only thing that could close the distance between the man in the rubble and the woman in the absence.

The compass pointed.

November sat in the silence after, and the silence was full of her name.
