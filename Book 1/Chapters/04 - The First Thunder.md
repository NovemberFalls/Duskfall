# CHAPTER FOUR: THE FIRST THUNDER

## Day 1 — The Siege Opens

---

The sound came before the light.

November was in the training yard when the world ended. He had been working the sweep — the same sweep, the same left-side gap, the same half-second of exposure that he had been trying to close for three months and that his body still refused to correct. His arms ached. The blister on his right palm had reopened through the linen bandage Horus had tied that morning, and the practice blade was slick with a thin film of blood and sweat that made the grip uncertain.

He was mid-swing when he heard it.

Not thunder. Thunder was something the sky did, something distant, something that belonged to weather and seasons and the ordinary violence of a world that didn't care about the people living in it. This was lower. Deeper. A sound that came from the ground as much as the air, that entered through the soles of his boots and climbed through his bones and arrived in his chest before his ears had finished processing it.

He stopped.

The practice blade was still raised — frozen in the middle of the reaper's arc, left side open, the gap that a child with a stick could exploit — and for a single, crystalline moment the world was perfectly still. The training yard. The pale morning sky. The forge-smoke drifting above the rooftops in its permanent, greasy haze. The sound of the city waking: cart wheels on cobblestone, a hammer ringing somewhere in the lower ring, a dog barking at something it didn't understand.

Then the sky broke.

The first impact hit the outer wall — he didn't see it land but he felt it, a shudder that ran through the flagstones beneath his feet like the earth itself had flinched. A heartbeat later, the sound reached him: a deep, concussive crack that was part stone breaking and part air being displaced and part something else, something chemical, something that smelled of pitch and hot metal and the particular acrid stink that November would later learn to associate with goblin alchemist's fire but which, in this moment, was simply the smell of a world he didn't recognise replacing the one he did.

He dropped the practice blade.

It clattered on the flagstones. The sound was absurd — the small, wooden noise of a training weapon hitting stone while the sky screamed.

The second impact was closer. The ground lurched. November staggered, caught his balance, and looked up in time to see a streak of orange arc over the rooftops to the south — trailing smoke, tumbling end over end, a ball of fire the size of a forge cart that was falling toward the city with the lazy, inevitable trajectory of something that had been thrown by a machine designed to throw things very far and very hard.

It hit somewhere beyond the training yard wall. The explosion — because that was what it was, he understood now, not thunder, not a forge accident, an explosion — punched a column of black smoke and orange flame above the roofline, and the shockwave hit him a moment later, a wall of hot air that tasted like burning oil and pushed him back a step and filled his ears with a ringing that sat behind everything else like a second heartbeat.

People were screaming.

Not in the training yard — the yard was empty, the way it always was at this hour, which was the reason he used it, which was a fact that belonged to a world that had existed thirty seconds ago and no longer applied. The screaming was coming from everywhere else. From the streets beyond the wall. From the buildings. From the direction of the Hall of the Fallen, which was —

November ran.

---

He ran the way civilians run — flat-footed, graceless, without the measured stride of the soldiers who were already pouring from the garrison barracks in formations that made sense to people who had trained for this. He ran through the gap between the training yard and the farrier's shop, through the alley that smelled of horse and hot iron, past the shuttered windows of the chandler's store where the old woman who sold tallow candles was standing in her doorway with her mouth open and her eyes fixed on the sky as if she expected it to explain itself.

Another impact. Closer. The ground bucked and November hit the wall of the chandler's shop with his shoulder, hard, the stone biting through his shirt and into the skin beneath. He pushed off. Kept running.

The street ahead was filling with people — not the organised movement of a city under siege but the raw, animal panic of people who had been eating breakfast or sweeping floors or nursing children when the world came apart. A man in a smith's apron was running in the wrong direction, toward the wall, shouting something November couldn't hear over the ringing. A woman was dragging two children by the arms, moving fast, her face set in an expression that was beyond fear and into something older and more mechanical — the instinct that said *get them away from here* without specifying where *here* was or what *away* looked like.

November shouldered past them. He was not thinking. Thinking was a process that required the kind of clarity that the ringing in his ears and the smoke in his lungs and the shaking of the ground beneath his feet had stolen from him. He was moving on something more basic than thought — the knowledge, lodged in his body like a splinter, that Horus was in the Hall of the Fallen and the Hall of the Fallen was in the direction the fire was coming from.

He turned the corner onto the street that ran behind the farrier's shop, the one that opened onto the square where the Hall of the Fallen sat at the end of a row of converted granaries. He could see the Hall's roof from here — the high, peaked line of it, the narrow windows, the chimney that hadn't worked in years and served now only as a landmark for the people who came to the Hall because they had nowhere else to go.

The roof was still there.

He held that thought. Gripped it like the practice blade — too tight, wrong technique, the grip of a man who didn't know how to hold things properly but held them anyway because letting go was not something he was built for.

Another impact hit the outer wall. The sound was different this time — a shrieking, tearing noise that meant something had given way, stone or metal or both, the anatomy of a fortification coming apart under a force it had been designed to resist and was failing. Debris rained from somewhere above — chunks of mortar, splinters of wood, a tile that shattered on the cobblestones three feet from his head.

He kept running.

The square opened before him and the Hall of the Fallen was there, its doors open, its staff already moving. He could see them — the healers and the orderlies and the stretcher-bearers who had, in the thirty seconds since the first impact, transitioned from their morning routines to the posture of people who had trained for this and hoped they would never have to prove it. They were carrying patients. Moving cots. The wounded from the night shift — the soldiers with the broken arms and the dock workers with the stitched shoulders and the woman whose husband had died in the night — were being relocated from the main ward to the deeper rooms, the ones with the thicker walls, the ones that had been storage vaults before the Hall was a Hall and which now served as the only approximation of shelter a building made of stone and hope could offer.

November crossed the square at a run. His boots slapped the wet cobblestones — it had rained in the night, briefly, the kind of rain Emberfall got that was more mist than water, and the stones were slick with a film of moisture and soot that made his footing uncertain. He reached the Hall's entrance. Grabbed the doorframe.

"Horus!"

The word came out raw. Louder than he intended, or maybe not loud enough — the ringing was still there, the second heartbeat, and he couldn't tell if his voice was cutting through it or being swallowed by it.

Inside, the Hall was chaos in motion. Controlled chaos — Horus's chaos, the organised kind, the version of disorder that had a logic to it if you knew where to look. Cots were being dragged toward the back wall. Linen bundles were being stacked against the windows. Someone — one of the junior healers, a young woman whose name November had never learned because she was new and quiet and Horus hadn't introduced them yet — was carrying an armload of surgical tools wrapped in cloth, her face the colour of ash.

He pushed inside. "Horus!"

"She's in the back." The junior healer — moving past him, not stopping, her eyes fixed on the task in front of her with the particular intensity of someone who was using work to keep terror at bay. "The overflow ward. She's moving the—"

The world detonated.

---

The blast came through the wall.

Not through the front — through the eastern wall of the Hall, the one that faced the alley between the Hall and the old grain warehouse, the wall that was three feet of fieldstone and mortar and had stood for forty years and came apart in a single, annihilating instant as if it had never been anything more than a suggestion.

November did not hear the impact. The sound bypassed his ears and entered his body directly — through his ribs, through his spine, through the fluid in his skull. It was not a noise. It was a force. The world became pressure and heat and a light so bright and so wrong that his vision whited out and he was blind, deaf, his lungs empty, his feet no longer touching the floor.

He was airborne.

The knowledge arrived in fragments, the way all knowledge arrived now — in pieces, out of order, each one making sense on its own and nonsense together. He was in the air. The air was full of things — stone, wood, dust, objects that had been part of a building and were now part of a cloud of debris that was travelling in the same direction he was, which was away from where the wall had been and toward where the opposite wall still was.

He hit something. The impact was general — not a specific point of contact but a whole-body collision with a surface that was hard and flat and tasted of dust. The floor. He was on the floor. He was on the floor and the floor was covered in rubble and the rubble was covered in dust and the dust was so thick in the air that breathing was like trying to inhale a blanket.

He coughed. The cough tore through his throat and brought up something that tasted like blood and chalk and the mineral tang of pulverised stone. His ears were — gone. Not ringing. Silent. A silence so total it had weight, a silence that pressed against his eardrums from the inside as if his skull had been filled with cotton and sealed shut.

He tried to stand.

His left arm didn't work. He discovered this the way he discovered everything now — by attempting the motion and receiving a response that was pure, white, nerve-deep pain. Something was wrong with the arm. Something was wrong with the arm and he could not look at it because his vision was a field of grey-white nothing, dust and smoke and the particulate remains of the eastern wall swirling in the air like a blizzard made of stone.

He rolled. Got his right arm under him. Pushed.

The world tilted. Not the world — him. He was tilting, his sense of balance shattered by the blast the way the wall had been shattered, the inner mechanism that told a body which way was up having been temporarily disconnected by the concussive force that had picked him up and thrown him across a room.

He got to his knees. The floor beneath him was wrong — lumpy, uneven, covered in things that his hands couldn't identify by touch alone. Broken stone. Splintered wood. Something soft. Cloth. Linen. The linen from the shelves — the shelves where he and Horus had eaten that morning, the alcove with the bench and the narrow window and the light that turned dust into gold.

*Horus.*

The name arrived with a clarity that cut through everything else — the pain, the dust, the silence, the disorientation. It was the first coherent thought since the blast, and it came not from his mind but from somewhere deeper, from the place where the compass lived, the inner chamber that measured him against the Creed and told him whether he was standing or falling.

"Horus!"

He couldn't hear his own voice. He felt it — the vibration in his throat, the strain of his vocal cords, the effort of pushing sound through lungs that were full of dust — but the silence ate it. He might have been shouting. He might have been whispering. The blast had taken his ability to tell the difference.

He stood. The room swayed around him. Not the room — the room was stationary, the room was rubble, the room had a hole in its eastern wall the size of a forge cart through which smoke and orange light poured in a thick, swirling current. The swaying was him. His body, trying to find its centre, trying to locate the point of balance that the blast had knocked loose.

He moved toward the back of the Hall. The overflow ward. She had been in the overflow ward. The junior healer had said that — *she's in the back, she's moving the* — and then the sentence had been finished by the thing that came through the wall.

The main ward was destroyed. Cots overturned. The contents of the shelves — bandages, splints, the jars of herbal salve that Horus mixed herself using a recipe she'd learned from someone she never talked about — scattered across the floor in a debris field of shattered glass and spilled liquid and the particular, intimate wreckage of a place that had existed to put people back together and had itself been torn apart.

Bodies.

He saw them and did not process them. Three — four — shapes on the floor that were not rubble, that had the dimensions and the weight and the terrible stillness of people who had been in the wrong room at the wrong moment. He did not stop. He could not stop. Stopping would mean looking, and looking would mean seeing, and seeing would mean understanding that the blast that had thrown him across the room had done worse to the people who had been closer to the wall than he was.

He stepped over a beam. Pushed through a door that was hanging from one hinge, the frame cracked, the wood splintered inward. The corridor beyond was dark — the narrow windows that had let in the light were blocked by rubble on the outside, and the only illumination came from behind him, through the hole in the wall, the orange glow of whatever was burning in the alley.

"Horus!" The vibration in his throat. The silence in his ears. He was shouting. He was shouting her name into a building that was half-destroyed and filling with smoke and the sound wasn't reaching anyone, not even him.

The overflow ward was at the end of the corridor. A storage room converted into a patient bay — Horus's doing, three weeks ago, when the regular wards ran out of space and she'd cleared the shelves and laid down pallets and told the orderlies that the linen could be stored elsewhere, these people could not. November had helped her move the supplies. He knew the room. He knew the door — heavy, wooden, with a handle that stuck and required a specific upward pressure to release.

The door was gone.

Not open — gone. The frame remained, set into the stone wall, but the door itself had been ripped from its hinges and lay on the corridor floor in two pieces, the wood split along the grain as if something had punched through it from the other side. Through the doorway, November could see the overflow ward.

The ceiling had come down.

Not all of it — the far corner was intact, the heavy beams still holding, the plaster cracked but in place. But the near side, the side closest to the eastern wall, the side where the blast would have hit — the ceiling had collapsed in a cascade of timber and stone and plaster that had buried everything beneath it. The pallets. The supplies. The patients who had been lying there when the world came apart.

November climbed over the ruined door. The rubble shifted under his feet. Something was burning — a lamp, maybe, or the herbal oil Horus used for cleaning wounds, the stuff she kept in brown glass bottles on the second shelf from the floor because the first shelf was for the things the patients might need and the second shelf was for the things she needed and the hierarchy of those shelves had mattered to her in a way that had made November smile when he understood it.

He dug.

His left arm was useless — it hung at his side, the pain a constant, grinding presence that he pushed to the periphery of his awareness the way Stoneveil pushed away the memory of the Anvil: not gone, not resolved, just moved to a place where it couldn't interfere with the task at hand. He dug with his right hand. Pulled stones. Shoved timbers. Tore at the rubble with fingers that were bleeding from the blister and the stone dust and the raw, desperate effort of a man searching for the only thing in the world that mattered.

"Horus."

Not shouting now. Saying it. The way he said the Creed — quietly, a promise being renewed, a fact being stated to the silence because the silence was all that was listening.

He found a pallet. Empty. The blankets were still on it, twisted, half-buried in plaster dust. He pulled them free. Found another pallet beneath — also empty, the frame cracked, the canvas torn. Whoever had been on these pallets had been moved before the blast. Or during. Or they were somewhere in this rubble and he hadn't found them yet.

He kept digging.

The smoke was getting thicker. It was coming through the corridor now — black, chemical, carrying the stink of alchemist's fire, the goblin pitch that clung where it landed and burned what it touched and could not be extinguished with water. November's lungs were burning. His eyes were streaming. The dust and the smoke met in his throat and produced a cough that doubled him over and left him on his knees in the rubble with his hand braced against a broken beam and his mouth open, gasping.

The sound was coming back.

It arrived in stages — first a low hum, then a whine, then the gradual, distorted return of the world's noise as his eardrums recovered from the blast. The hum became a roar. The whine became screaming. The silence peeled away and beneath it was everything — fire, voices, the crack of stone breaking somewhere above him, the distant, rhythmic impact of more siege engine rounds hitting the outer wall, the sound of a city being torn open.

And voices. Closer. Shouting.

"Evacuate! Evacuate the Hall! Everyone out!"

Soldiers. The words cut through the smoke — not directions he understood but orders, military orders, the clipped, authoritative voice of someone who had been trained to give commands in exactly this situation and was doing so with the precise, mechanical efficiency of a man who had decided that the building was lost and the people in it needed to be somewhere else.

Hands on him. Someone grabbed his right arm — a soldier, a Legionnaire, the armour visible through the smoke as a smear of dark metal and the crimson sash that marked garrison troops. The soldier was pulling him. Dragging him toward the door.

November pulled free.

"There are people in here." His voice was a rasp. The dust and the smoke had reduced it to something barely recognisable. "The overflow ward — the ceiling came down, there are people—"

"The building is on fire." The soldier was not looking at him. The soldier was looking at the smoke filling the corridor, at the orange glow reflecting off the walls, at the structural reality of a stone building with a compromised eastern wall and a ceiling that was failing in sections and a fire spreading through the ground floor. "We're clearing everyone we can reach. Move."

"My—" The word caught. Not on the smoke. On something else. The inadequacy of language to describe what Horus was to him in terms that a soldier pulling him through a burning building would understand or care about. *My lover. My healer. My reason for standing in the training yard at an hour when no one else is awake, hitting a piece of wood with a broken practice blade until my hands bleed, because she showed me that I was worth the effort and I am trying every day to prove her right.*

"There's a healer. A woman. She was in the back—"

"We're clearing the building. Move. Now."

The soldier's hand was on his arm again. Not gentle — the grip of a man who had been trained to remove civilians from burning structures and who did not have time for the particular, devastating specificity of one man's loss in the middle of a catastrophe that was consuming an entire city.

November was pulled through the corridor. Past the ruined door. Through the main ward, where other soldiers were carrying the wounded — the ones they could reach, the ones who were still alive, the ones whose injuries allowed them to be moved. He saw the bodies on the floor and this time he could not avoid processing them. Three patients. The blast had been directly above their cots. They were not wounded. They were finished, in the way that word meant when there was nothing left to be done.

The junior healer — the young woman with the ash-white face — was being carried out by two orderlies. She was conscious. Her leg was wrong, bent at an angle that no leg should achieve, and she was making a sound that was not screaming and not crying but something between, the sound of a person whose body was telling her things she did not want to know.

November searched her face. She was not Horus. She was not Horus and that fact was simultaneously a relief and a devastation, because it meant Horus was still somewhere in this building, in the rubble, in the smoke, in the silence behind the fire.

"Horus!" He shouted it into the smoke, into the noise, into the indifferent machinery of a military evacuation that was designed to save as many people as possible and could not — would not — stop for one.

No answer.

---

The street was worse.

He was deposited outside the Hall by the soldier who had dragged him through the corridor — deposited the way a sack of grain is deposited, without ceremony, in the space between the Hall's entrance and the fountain in the centre of the square that hadn't worked in years and now served as a landmark for a world that had lost every other point of reference.

November stood in the square and the siege roared around him.

The sky was wrong. The pale, steel-grey morning he had trained under — the sky that tasted of forge-smoke and smelled of the farrier's coal and belonged to a city that was ugly and hard and his — had been replaced by something from a nightmare. Columns of black smoke rose from a dozen points along the outer wall, where the siege engines' rounds had hit. Orange fire crawled along the rooftops of the buildings nearest the wall — the warehouses, the workshops, the cramped apartments where the forge workers lived in shifts. The air was thick with particulate — ash, stone dust, the chemical haze of alchemist's fire — and through it, the sun was a pale, brown disc that gave light without illumination, like a lantern seen through dirty water.

More impacts. The sound was constant now — not individual strikes but a rhythm, a drumbeat, the siege engines launching in sequence. November could hear them even through the damage in his ears: the deep, grinding creak of the trebuchet's arm, the whip-crack of the catapult releases, the whistling shriek of the projectiles as they arced over the wall and fell on the city behind it.

They were not aiming at the wall. They were aiming at the city.

The realisation settled into him with a cold, sick weight. The rounds that had hit the Hall, that had taken the eastern wall, that had buried the overflow ward — those were not strays. They were deliberate. The siege engines were targeting the buildings behind the wall, the support structures, the places where the wounded were tended and the supplies were stored and the civilians sheltered. They were taking out the infrastructure of survival before the infantry arrived.

Soldiers ran past him. Legionnaires in formation, moving toward the wall, their boots hitting the cobblestones in a synchronised rhythm that sounded obscene in its order — the mechanical precision of trained men doing trained things while the world burned. They did not look at him. They did not slow. November was not wearing armour. He was not carrying a weapon. He was a man in a sweat-stained shirt with a bandaged hand and blood on his face from a cut he didn't remember receiving, standing in the middle of a square while the military flowed around him like water around a stone.

He was invisible.

The word arrived and it was exact. He was invisible. Not hidden — standing in plain sight, in the middle of the street, with smoke in his hair and dust on his skin and the name of a woman on his lips. But invisible in the way that mattered: he was not a soldier, not an officer, not a resource. He was a civilian. He was nobody's priority.

A cart rattled past — two soldiers and a driver, the bed loaded with wounded, the wheels bouncing over rubble. Someone was moaning. Someone else was quiet in a way that meant they were past moaning. The cart did not stop. It was heading toward the inner ring, toward the Emberheart, toward the walls behind the walls where the people who mattered were protected by the people who would die to protect them.

November stood in the smoke and watched it go.

He thought about the compass.

It was there. Beneath the fear, beneath the ringing, beneath the pain in his arm and the dust in his lungs and the hollowing emptiness where the knowledge of Horus's location should have been. The compass was there because it was always there — the inner mechanism that measured him against the Creed, the quiet voice that asked the question he could not avoid even in the middle of a city that was coming apart around him.

*Am I living the Creed?*

He looked at the Hall. Smoke was pouring from the hole in the eastern wall. Soldiers were bringing the last of the patients out — carrying them on stretchers, on doors ripped from their frames, on their backs. The junior healer on a stretcher, her broken leg splinted with what looked like a piece of door frame, her face grey.

Horus was not among them.

He looked at the soldiers on the wall. The formations moving into position. The officers shouting orders that were swallowed by the noise. The war-mages on the bastions, their hands raised, the green-blue light of veilfire flickering at their fingertips as they prepared wards that would catch what the stone couldn't.

No one was looking for one healer.

*We do not abandon.*

He moved.

Not toward the wall. Not toward the inner ring. Back toward the Hall. Back toward the building that was on fire and filling with smoke and structurally unsound and being evacuated by soldiers who had already decided it was lost. He moved because the compass pointed in one direction and that direction was toward her, and the fact that the direction was also toward a burning building was a detail that the compass did not consider.

A soldier stepped into his path. Not the one who had dragged him out — a different one, a sergeant by the markings on his pauldron, older, his face set in the flat, professional expression of a man who had seen civilians do stupid things in combat zones and had no intention of letting this one do it on his watch.

"Building's cleared. No one goes back in."

"There's a healer. She was in the overflow ward. I didn't find her—"

"Building's cleared. All accessible areas have been swept. If she wasn't found, she wasn't in an accessible area."

The words hit him. Accessible area. The military language for the places that could be reached without unacceptable risk. The rooms where the ceiling hadn't come down, where the fire hadn't spread, where the structure was sound enough to send a man in and expect to get him back. The overflow ward, with its collapsed ceiling and its burning lamp oil and its rubble-choked doorway, was not an accessible area.

Horus, if she was there, was not accessible.

"No." The word was too quiet. He said it again, louder. "No. She's in there. I need—"

"You need to clear the area." The sergeant's voice was not unkind. It was the voice of a man who had delivered bad news in burning cities before and who understood that kindness and efficiency were, in this moment, the same thing. "The outer wall is taking fire. This district is in the bombardment zone. We're pulling everyone back to secondary positions behind the inner market. You need to move."

Another impact — this one close, close enough that the ground shook and a section of roofline two buildings over collapsed in a cascade of tile and timber that sent a cloud of dust rolling across the square. The sergeant flinched. November did not. He was beyond flinching. Flinching required the kind of self-preservation instinct that was currently being overridden by something stronger.

"I'm not leaving without her."

The sergeant looked at him. Really looked — the way Horus looked at patients, the way she assessed damage and determined what could be saved and what was past saving. The sergeant's eyes moved across November's face, his injured arm, his bandaged hand, his bare chest under the torn shirt, the absence of anything that resembled military equipment or military purpose.

"You're a civilian."

It was not a question.

"Yes."

"Then you're not my problem. But you're not going back in that building."

The sergeant turned and jogged toward the wall, where his men were forming up, where the things that were his problem were waiting. He did not look back at November. There was no reason to. The building was cleared. The accessible areas had been swept. The inaccessible areas were inaccessible. The math was done.

November stood in the square.

The smoke from the Hall thickened. Through the hole in the eastern wall, he could see the glow of the fire spreading — not fast, not the explosive rush of alchemist's fire, but the steady, deliberate progress of a fire feeding on wood and linen and lamp oil and the accumulated materials of a place that had spent its existence storing the things that burning buildings were made of. The roof would go next. Then the upper floors. Then the storage rooms in the back, the ones with the thick walls, the ones Horus had converted into patient bays because there was nowhere else.

He stood and watched and the compass spun.

*We do not abandon.*

But what did you do when you couldn't reach the person you refused to abandon? What did the Creed say about walls of fire and collapsed ceilings and the flat, professional voice of a sergeant who had swept the accessible areas and found nothing? What did the compass point to when the direction it insisted on was also the direction that led to his own death, and dying meant he would never find her?

*Should death come seeking, we will not flinch — but neither will we seek it.*

He stared at the Hall. The fire grew. The smoke poured upward and joined the black columns rising from the rest of the outer ring and became part of the new sky, the wrong sky, the one that had replaced the pale morning he'd trained under.

She might not be in there. She might have been moved. She might have been in the corridor when the blast hit and been carried out by someone he hadn't seen, taken to a triage point, loaded onto one of the carts heading for the inner ring. She might be alive, somewhere in this chaos, separated from him by the same indifferent machinery that had separated them in the first place — the blast, the smoke, the evacuation, the fact that no one was keeping track of one healer from the Hall of the Fallen when the walls were being hammered and the streets were on fire and the entire city was trying to survive the next thirty seconds.

Or she might be under the rubble in the overflow ward, in the inaccessible area, in the place the soldiers had decided was not worth the risk.

He did not know. He could not know. The blast had taken the knowing and replaced it with a void, a silence shaped exactly like Horus, and the void was worse than an answer because an answer — even the worst answer — was something you could stand on.

Another round hit the outer wall. The impact sent a tremor through the square and November felt it in his teeth. The wall — the Sundered Gate's eastern bastion — was cracking. He could see it from here: a fissure running diagonally across the stonework, the rune-wards flickering along its length, the dwarven enchantments stuttering as the stone they were bound to shifted.

The gates were closing.

He could see them — the great iron doors of the passage between the outer ring and the middle ring, the secondary gate that separated the Iron Marches from the Anvil District. Soldiers were pulling them shut. The massive hinges groaned — a sound that carried across the square despite everything, deep and final, the sound of a world getting smaller.

Once those gates closed, the outer ring was sealed. Everyone in it would stay in it — soldiers on the wall, civilians in the bombardment zone, the wounded who hadn't been evacuated, the dead who no longer cared. The military was making a decision: the outer ring was the battleground, and the battleground was not a place for people who didn't fight.

November looked at the closing gates. He looked at the burning Hall.

He looked at the sky, which was black and orange and wrong.

He looked at his hands. His right hand — bandaged, bloody, the blister weeping through the linen Horus had wrapped with quick, overlapping passes that covered the wound without restricting his movement. His left arm — hanging, the pain a white, persistent scream that he had pushed down so far it had become part of him, a new organ, a thing he carried the way he carried the Creed.

*Standing.*

He was standing.

*Sober.*

He was sober.

*Useful.*

He was—

He was a man in a burning city with no weapon and no armour and no idea where the woman he loved was, and the gates were closing, and the soldiers weren't looking for her because one healer in a siege was a rounding error, a detail too small for the mathematics of survival to account for.

He moved.

Not toward the Hall. The Hall was fire. Not toward the inner ring. The inner ring was closing. He moved along the edge of the square, toward the side streets, toward the buildings between the Hall and the secondary gate, because if Horus had been carried out — if she was wounded, if she was in the triage flow, if she was anywhere that wasn't under three feet of rubble — she would be between here and there. In the stream of wounded and evacuees. In the machinery of a city trying to save its own.

He searched.

Through the smoke. Through the streets that were becoming unrecognisable — the familiar landmarks of his daily route between the training yard and the Hall obscured by dust and debris and the particular devastation of a bombardment that had turned buildings into rubble and rubble into barricades. He checked faces. Every stretcher that passed, every cart, every knot of wounded civilians being herded toward the inner ring by soldiers who moved them the way shepherds move flocks: firmly, impersonally, with no interest in any individual animal's preferences.

He checked the faces of the dead.

They lay where they had fallen — in doorways, under collapsed awnings, in the middle of streets where the siege rounds had caught them in the open. He knelt beside each one. Turned them, when he could, with his one working hand. Looked at their faces. Looked for the dark hair and the lean features and the eyes that were warm when she let them be and clinical when the work demanded it.

She was not among them.

He kept looking. The bombardment continued above him — rounds arcing over the wall, striking the outer ring, the rhythm so constant it was becoming part of the world's new architecture, as much a fixture as the forge-smoke and the soot. Soldiers passed. Civilians passed. No one stopped for the man with the injured arm, checking bodies in the street, calling a name that the smoke ate.

"Horus!"

Nothing.

"Horus!"

The smoke. The fire. The sound of a gate closing somewhere behind him — not the main gate, a smaller one, a postern, the kind of door that soldiers sealed when the perimeter was being locked down.

"Horus!"

He reached the secondary gate as the last gap was closing. A Legionnaire stood at the threshold — not blocking it, just standing, the final man before the iron met the stone. The soldier looked at November. Saw the blood. The arm. The wild, dust-covered face of a man who had been through an explosion and had spent the time since running through a burning city shouting a name that no one answered.

"In or out?"

November looked back. The outer ring behind him — smoke, fire, the distant shapes of soldiers on the wall preparing for what came after the bombardment. The Hall of the Fallen, invisible now behind the column of black smoke that rose from where the eastern wall had been.

She was not behind him. He had looked. He had checked every face, every stretcher, every body. She was not in the streets and she was not in the evacuees and she was not among the dead he could reach.

She might be ahead. In the inner ring. In the triage stations that would be set up behind the secondary wall. In the safer ground where the wounded were being taken, where the healers — the ones who survived — would be working, where the machinery of care would continue to grind because that was what machinery did: it ground on, regardless, until it ran out of parts.

Or she was in the overflow ward, under the rubble, in the inaccessible area, and he would never find her.

He stepped through the gate.

The iron closed behind him.

---

The middle ring was a different world.

Not better. Not safer. But different — the difference between being inside the fire and being near it, between the direct impact of the bombardment and its echo. Here, the buildings were intact. The streets were crowded — refugees from the outer ring flowing inward, military runners carrying messages between the wall and the command posts, civilians standing in doorways watching the smoke rise above the outer wall with expressions that ranged from shock to calculation to the flat, careful nothing of people who were already deciding what to do if things got worse.

November stood in the flow and it parted around him.

He was shaking. He noticed this the way he noticed the pain in his arm — as a fact, a condition, something that existed outside his ability to control it. His right hand was trembling. His legs were unsteady. The adrenaline that had carried him through the bombing and the search and the desperate sprint through the outer ring was draining, and what it left behind was the raw, exposed nerve of a man who had lost something and couldn't name it because naming it meant accepting it was lost.

He looked at the people around him. Faces. Hundreds of faces. Wounded soldiers on stretchers. Civilians with ash in their hair and terror in their eyes. Children — children, gods help them, children crying without making sound because they were too frightened to make sound, clinging to adults who were too frightened to offer comfort.

He checked every face.

She was not among them.

He walked. Not with purpose — he had no purpose now, no destination, no plan. The compass was still there but it was spinning, pointing in every direction at once, because the direction it wanted — toward her — was a direction that required knowing where she was, and he did not know.

The morning — the last good morning, the heel of the bread, the light through the narrow window, her shoulder against his — was seven hundred years ago. It had happened to a different man in a different world, a world where the sky was the colour of old steel and the worst thing that could happen was a blister and the only gap that mattered was the one in his guard on the left side.

November stood in the middle ring of Emberfall while the siege raged beyond the wall and he had never been more alone.

*Am I living the Creed?*

He didn't know.

*Am I standing?*

Yes.

*Am I sober?*

Yes.

*Am I useful?*

He looked at his hands. The bandaged right, the useless left. The hands of a man who had dug through rubble and found nothing and checked the faces of the dead and found nothing and shouted a name into smoke until his voice was raw and found nothing.

No.

He was not useful. Not yet. Not here. Not like this.

But he was standing.

He wiped the blood from his face with his right hand. The blister split further. The linen bandage — Horus's bandage, tied with quick, overlapping passes, the work of hands that were steadier than anything he knew — was dark with blood and dust and the particular grime of a city that had been shelled.

He looked at the wall. The outer wall, visible above the rooftops of the middle ring, dark against the smoke. The soldiers on it. The war-mages. The formations. The machinery of defence doing what it was built to do.

He looked at the gate behind him. Sealed. Iron against stone.

He looked at the smoke.

Somewhere in that smoke — in the ruins, in the rubble, in the triage stations or the evacuation routes or the inaccessible areas that the soldiers had swept and abandoned — Horus was alive or she was dead, and November Falls did not know which, and the not knowing was a wound that no healer in Bloodhollow could stitch shut.

He stood in the street.

The siege continued.

The sky stayed wrong.

And the man who had woken that morning to the sound of her breathing, who had trained badly and earnestly in the yard where no one watched, who had eaten the heel of the bread and said the Creed and felt, for one hour, like the man he was trying to become — that man stood in the ash and the noise and the absence and checked the compass one more time.

*Standing. Sober. Alive.*

Not enough.

But it was what he had.
