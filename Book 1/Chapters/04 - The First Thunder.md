# CHAPTER FOUR: THE FIRST THUNDER

## Day 1 — The Siege Opens

---

The sound came before the light.

November was mid-swing when he heard it — not thunder, something lower, something that entered through his boots and climbed his bones and arrived in his chest before his ears had finished. He stopped. The practice blade frozen in the reaper's arc, left side open, the gap a child with a stick could exploit.

The training yard. The pale sky. Forge-smoke drifting. A dog barking at something it didn't understand.

Then the sky broke.

The first impact hit the outer wall. He didn't see it land but felt the shudder through the flagstones — stone breaking, air displaced, and something chemical beneath it, pitch and hot metal and a stink he'd later learn was goblin alchemist's fire. In this moment it was just the smell of one world replacing another.

He dropped the practice blade. It clattered on the flagstones, a small wooden noise while the sky screamed.

The second impact was closer. The ground lurched. He staggered, caught his balance, looked up in time to see a streak of orange arc over the rooftops — trailing smoke, tumbling, a ball of fire the size of a forge cart falling with lazy, inevitable trajectory.

It hit beyond the training yard wall. The explosion punched black smoke and orange flame above the roofline and the shockwave hit him a moment later — hot air that tasted like burning oil, the ringing settling behind everything else like a second heartbeat.

People were screaming. Not in the yard — everywhere else. From the streets, the buildings, the direction of the Hall of the Fallen.

November ran.

---

He ran the way civilians run — flat-footed, graceless, without the measured stride of soldiers already pouring from the garrison in formations that made sense. Through the gap between the training yard and the farrier's shop, past the chandler's store where the old woman stood in her doorway with her mouth open and her eyes on the sky.

Another impact. The ground bucked and he hit the wall shoulder-first, stone biting through his shirt. He pushed off. Kept running.

The street was filling — not organised movement but animal panic. A smith running the wrong direction, toward the wall. A woman dragging two children by the arms, her face set in something older than fear. The instinct that said *get them away* without specifying where.

He shouldered past. He was not thinking. The ringing and the smoke and the shaking had stolen clarity. He was moving on something more basic — the knowledge, lodged in him like a splinter, that Horus was in the Hall of the Fallen and the Hall was in the direction the fire was coming from.

The square opened before him. The Hall's doors were open, staff already moving — healers and orderlies and stretcher-bearers who had transitioned from morning routines to the posture of people who'd trained for this and hoped they'd never prove it. Patients being carried. Cots being moved. The wounded from the night shift relocated to the deeper rooms, the ones with thicker walls.

He crossed the square at a run. Boots slipping on wet cobblestones — it had rained in the night, barely, and the stones were slick with moisture and soot.

"Horus!"

Raw. Too loud or not loud enough — the ringing ate everything and he couldn't tell where his voice ended and the noise began.

Inside, the Hall was Horus's kind of chaos — organised, with a logic to it if you knew where to look. Cots dragged toward the back wall. Linen stacked against windows. A junior healer — new, young, ash-faced — carrying surgical tools wrapped in cloth.

"She's in the back." The junior healer didn't stop, her eyes fixed on the task with the particular intensity of someone using work to keep terror at bay. "The overflow ward. She's moving the—"

The world detonated.

---

The blast came through the eastern wall.

Three feet of fieldstone and mortar, forty years standing. It came apart in a single instant as if it had never been more than a suggestion.

November did not hear the impact. The sound bypassed his ears and entered his body — through his ribs, his spine, the fluid in his skull. Not a noise. A force. The world became pressure and heat and a light so bright his vision whited out and he was blind, deaf, his lungs empty, his feet off the floor.

He was airborne. The knowledge arrived in fragments — in pieces, out of order. He was in the air. The air was full of things that had been part of a building.

He hit the floor. Not a specific point of contact — a whole-body collision with a surface that was hard and flat and tasted of dust. Rubble covered in dust. Dust so thick that breathing was like inhaling a blanket.

He coughed. Blood and chalk and pulverised stone.

His left arm didn't work. He discovered this by trying to use it and receiving a response of pure, white, nerve-deep pain. His vision was grey-white nothing — dust and smoke and the particulate remains of the eastern wall.

He rolled. Got his right arm under him. Pushed. The world tilted — not the world, him, his balance shattered the way the wall had been shattered.

Knees. The floor beneath him was wrong — lumpy, uneven. Broken stone. Splintered wood. Something soft. Linen. The linen from the shelves where they'd eaten that morning.

*Horus.*

The name cut through everything.

"Horus!"

He felt the vibration in his throat but the silence ate it. The blast had taken his ability to tell if he was shouting or whispering.

He stood. The room swayed. A hole in the eastern wall the size of a forge cart, smoke and orange light pouring through it. He moved toward the back. The overflow ward. *She's in the back, she's moving the—*

The main ward was destroyed. Cots overturned. Bandages, splints, the jars of herbal salve she mixed herself — scattered across the floor in shattered glass and spilled liquid.

Bodies. Three, four — shapes on the floor that had the dimensions and the terrible stillness of people who had been in the wrong room at the wrong moment. He did not stop.

Through a door hanging from one hinge. The corridor beyond was dark, the narrow windows blocked by rubble. The only light came from behind him — the orange glow of whatever burned in the alley.

The overflow ward door was gone. Not open — gone. Ripped from its hinges, split along the grain. Through the doorway, he could see the ward.

The ceiling had come down.

Not all of it. The far corner held, heavy beams intact. But the near side — closest to the eastern wall, closest to the blast — had collapsed in a cascade of timber and stone that buried everything beneath it. The pallets. The patients.

He climbed over the ruined door. Something was burning — a lamp, or the herbal oil she kept in brown glass bottles on the second shelf because the first shelf was for things patients might need.

He dug.

His left arm was useless. He dug with his right hand. Pulled stones. Shoved timbers. Fingers bleeding from the blister and the stone dust and the raw effort of a man searching for the only thing that mattered.

"Horus." Not shouting now. Saying it the way he said the Creed — quietly, a promise being renewed, a fact stated to the silence because the silence was all that was listening.

He found a pallet. Empty. Blankets twisted, half-buried. Another beneath — also empty, frame cracked, canvas torn. Moved before the blast. Or during. Or somewhere in this rubble he hadn't reached yet.

The smoke thickened. Black, chemical — alchemist's fire, the goblin pitch that clung and burned and couldn't be quenched with water. His lungs were burning. His eyes streaming. Dust and smoke met in his throat and he doubled over, coughing on his knees, hand braced on a broken beam.

Sound came back in stages. A hum. A whine. Then the gradual return of everything — fire, voices, stone breaking above, the distant rhythmic impact of more siege rounds hitting the wall. A city being torn open.

"Evacuate! Everyone out!"

Hands on him. A soldier — Legionnaire, dark armour and crimson sash — grabbing his right arm, pulling him toward the door.

November pulled free.

"There are people in here. The ceiling came down—"

"The building is on fire." The soldier was looking at the smoke filling the corridor, the orange glow on the walls. "We're clearing everyone we can reach. Move."

"There's a healer. A woman. She was in the back—"

"We're clearing the building. Move. *Now.*"

The soldier's grip tightened and November was pulled through the corridor. Past the ruined door. Through the main ward, where other soldiers carried wounded — the ones they could reach, the ones still alive. He saw the bodies on the floor and this time could not avoid them. Three patients. The blast had been directly above their cots.

The junior healer was being carried out. Conscious. Her leg bent at an angle no leg should achieve, and she was making a sound between screaming and crying — a person whose body was telling her things she didn't want to know.

She was not Horus.

"Horus!" He shouted it into the smoke, into the machinery of a military evacuation designed to save as many as possible and unable to stop for one.

No answer.

---

The square. Deposited outside the way a sack of grain is deposited.

November stood and the siege roared around him.

The sky was wrong. The pale morning he'd trained under — gone, replaced by columns of black smoke from a dozen points along the wall. Orange fire along the nearest rooftops. The air thick with ash and stone dust and the chemical haze of alchemist's fire. The sun a pale brown disc that gave light without illumination.

More impacts — constant now, not individual strikes but a rhythm. The siege engines launching in sequence. And they were not aiming at the wall. They were aiming at the city.

The rounds that hit the Hall, that took the eastern wall, that buried the overflow ward — those were deliberate. Taking out the infrastructure of survival before the infantry arrived.

Soldiers ran past him. Legionnaires in formation, boots synchronised, heading toward the wall. They did not look at him. He was a man in a sweat-stained shirt with a bandaged hand and blood on his face, standing in the square while the military flowed around him like water around a stone.

He was invisible. Not hidden — standing in plain sight. But invisible in the way that mattered: not a soldier, not an officer, not a resource. A civilian. Nobody's priority.

He moved back toward the Hall. A sergeant stepped into his path — older, face set in the flat expression of a man who'd seen civilians do stupid things in combat zones.

"Building's cleared. No one goes back in."

"There's a healer. She was in the overflow ward—"

"All accessible areas have been swept. If she wasn't found, she wasn't in an accessible area."

The words hit him. *Accessible area.* The military language for rooms where the ceiling hadn't come down, where the fire hadn't spread. The overflow ward was not an accessible area.

"No." Too quiet. Louder: "No. She's in there—"

"The outer wall is taking fire. This district is in the bombardment zone. We're pulling everyone back to secondary positions. You need to move."

Another impact — close enough that the ground shook and a roofline two buildings over collapsed in tile and timber. The sergeant flinched. November did not.

"I'm not leaving without her."

The sergeant looked at him. Really looked — the way Horus looked at patients. Assessed the injured arm, the bandaged hand, the absence of anything military.

"You're a civilian."

"Yes."

"Then you're not my problem. But you're not going back in that building."

The sergeant jogged toward the wall. The building was cleared. The accessible areas swept. The math was done.

November stood in the square. The smoke from the Hall thickened. Through the hole in the eastern wall, the fire was spreading — steady, deliberate, feeding on wood and linen and lamp oil. The roof would go next. Then the upper floors. Then the storage rooms in the back. The ones she'd converted into patient bays because there was nowhere else.

*We do not abandon.*

But what did you do when you couldn't reach the person you refused to abandon? What did the Creed say about collapsed ceilings and a sergeant who'd swept the accessible areas and found nothing?

*Should death come seeking, we will not flinch — but neither will we seek it.*

She might not be in there. She might have been in the corridor when the blast hit, carried out by someone he hadn't seen. Taken to a triage point. Loaded onto a cart heading for the inner ring. She might be alive somewhere in this chaos, separated by the same machinery that separated them in the first place.

Or she might be under the rubble. In the inaccessible area.

He did not know. The not knowing was worse than an answer because an answer — even the worst answer — was something you could stand on.

---

The gates were closing.

The great iron doors between the outer ring and the middle ring. Soldiers pulling them shut. The hinges groaned — deep, final. The sound of a world getting smaller.

November looked at the closing gates. He looked at the burning Hall.

He moved. Not toward the Hall — the Hall was fire. Not toward the inner ring. Along the edge of the square, toward the side streets, because if Horus had been carried out she would be between here and there. In the stream of wounded. In the machinery of a city trying to save its own.

He searched. Through the smoke. Through streets becoming unrecognisable — familiar landmarks obscured by dust and debris. He checked faces. Every stretcher, every cart, every knot of civilians being herded toward the inner ring by soldiers who moved them the way shepherds move flocks.

He checked the faces of the dead.

They lay where they'd fallen — in doorways, under collapsed awnings, in the open. He knelt beside each one. Turned them with his one working hand. Looked for dark hair and lean features and eyes that were warm when she let them be.

She was not among them.

He reached the secondary gate as the last gap was closing. A Legionnaire at the threshold — the final man before iron met stone.

"In or out?"

November looked back. Smoke, fire, the shapes of soldiers on the wall. The Hall invisible behind its column of black smoke.

She was not behind him. He had looked. Every face, every stretcher, every body.

She might be ahead. In the triage stations behind the secondary wall. In the safer ground where wounded were being taken, where healers who survived would be working.

Or she was in the overflow ward and he would never find her.

He stepped through the gate.

The iron closed behind him.

---

The middle ring was a different world. Not better — different. Buildings intact. Streets crowded with refugees from the outer ring, military runners, civilians in doorways watching the smoke rise with expressions ranging from shock to the flat, careful nothing of people already deciding what to do if things got worse.

November stood in the flow and it parted around him.

He was shaking. His right hand trembling. His legs unsteady. The adrenaline draining, and what it left behind was the raw, exposed nerve of a man who had lost something and couldn't name it because naming it meant accepting it was lost.

He checked every face. Hundreds of faces. Wounded soldiers. Civilians with ash in their hair. Children crying without making sound because they were too frightened to make sound.

She was not among them.

He walked. No purpose, no destination. The compass was still there but it was spinning, because the direction it wanted — toward her — required knowing where she was.

The morning — the heel of the bread, the light through the narrow window, her shoulder against his — was seven hundred years ago.

He stood in the middle ring while the siege raged and he had never been more alone.

*Am I standing?*

Yes.

*Am I sober?*

Yes.

*Am I useful?*

He looked at his hands. The bandaged right, the useless left. The hands of a man who had dug through rubble and found nothing and checked the faces of the dead and found nothing and shouted a name into smoke until his voice was raw and found nothing.

No. Not useful. Not yet. Not here. Not like this.

But he was standing.

He wiped the blood from his face. The blister split further. The linen bandage — Horus's bandage, tied that morning with hands steadier than anything he knew — was dark with blood and dust.

Somewhere in that smoke — in the ruins, in the triage stations, in the inaccessible areas — Horus was alive or she was dead, and November Falls did not know which, and the not knowing was a wound that no healer in Bloodhollow could stitch shut.

The siege continued.

The sky stayed wrong.

And the man who had woken that morning to the sound of her breathing, who had trained badly in the yard where no one watched, who had eaten the heel of the bread and said the Creed and felt, for one hour, like the man he was trying to become — that man stood in the ash and the noise and the absence and checked the compass one more time.

*Standing. Sober. Alive.*

Not enough.

But it was what he had.
