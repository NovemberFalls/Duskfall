# CHAPTER EIGHT: THE BONES SPEAK

## Day 2 — After the First Assault

---

The dead came back in pieces.

Not the bodies — the numbers. They arrived in fragments throughout the evening, carried by runners and War-Chiefs and the particular, drawn silence of warriors who had spent the day dying and were now required to count how many of them had succeeded. Thokk stood at the command fire on the ridge's western face and received each fragment the way a man receives blows in a fight he cannot leave: with his feet planted, his jaw set, and the understanding that the next one would be worse.

Malga came first.

She climbed the ridge with the specific, heavy stride of a woman whose body was intact but whose warband was not. Her left arm was bandaged — not by a shaman, but by herself, the wrapping tight and crude, the knot tied with the one-handed efficiency of someone who had been tying her own wounds since she was old enough to earn them. The blood had soaked through in a dark bloom that looked black in the firelight.

She stood before Thokk and gave her count.

"Forty-seven dead. Thirty-one wounded who'll fight tomorrow. Nineteen who won't."

Thokk did the math. Malga's vanguard had been three hundred. Forty-seven dead brought it to two hundred and fifty-three. Nineteen who wouldn't fight brought the effective strength to two hundred and thirty-four.

The vanguard had lost a fifth of its strength hitting a gate that hadn't opened.

"Da gate?"

"Standing." Malga said the word the way she said everything — flat, honest, the word arriving without the cushion of explanation or excuse. "Da rune-wards pushed back every ram strike. We got close — da third crew nearly set the breach charges before da archers took dem. But da wards flare and da rams bounce and ya can't set a charge on a surface dat won't let ya touch it."

"How many ram crews?"

"Four. Sent dem in rotation. Lost two complete crews in da Throat." She paused. The fire moved across her face, showing the scar where her ear had been, the flat planes of a jaw that had absorbed more punishment than bone should be able to hold. "Da Throat is a killing ground, Blood-Chief. Fifty feet wide, walls on both sides, murder holes above. Oil. Arrows. Da humans pour it down like rain and dere's nowhere to go except forward or back, and forward is da gate, and da gate won't break."

"It'll break."

"Not wit rams. Not while da wards hold."

Thokk looked at her. Malga Bonefist did not tell him what he wanted to hear. She told him what she saw. That was why she led the vanguard — because the warriors who went first needed a leader who would not lie to them about what going first cost.

"Da bombardment?"

"Skrixx's engines cracked da eastern bastion. I saw da ward-light flicker — da rune-work is damaged on dat side. He hit da same spot six, seven times. Da stone held but da magic didn't."

This was something. Not enough. But something.

"Get yer wounded to da shamans. Tell yer warriors da rites are at moonrise."

Malga nodded. She turned. Stopped.

"Thokk."

He waited.

"Da humans in dat Throat. Dey fight like dey've got nowhere to go."

"Dey don't."

Malga looked at him. Whatever she saw in his face, she did not comment on it. She walked down the ridge, and the darkness took her, and Thokk turned back to the fire and waited for the next count.

---

Krogan brought the eastern numbers.

He was bleeding from a wound on his scalp that he either hadn't noticed or didn't care about. The blood had dried in a dark line from his temple to his jaw, following the groove of an old scar, the two wounds — one fresh, one ancient — running the same course like a river returning to a channel it had carved years before.

"Sixty-three dead. Forty-four wounded. Twenty-two out."

Worse. Krogan's eastern assault had been three hundred warriors hitting the weakened section of wall — the patch, the breach point, the place where the stone was different and the mortar was new and the humans knew it was vulnerable because they'd been patching it since the last time someone came through.

"Da breach?"

"We got on da parapet twice." Krogan's deep voice carried the particular weight of a man describing something he had seen from close enough to taste. "First time, da ladders held for eleven minutes. Got thirty warriors up. Da Ironborn pushed dem back — dey have heavy infantry on dat section, Blood-Chief. Armoured. Disciplined. Dey fight like da wall is part of deir body."

"And da second time?"

"Longer. We held da parapet for — I don't know. Da time gets wrong in a fight like dat. Long enough dat I thought we had it. Long enough dat da warriors behind me started pushing forward because dey could feel da line bending." He paused. "Den dey redirected a war engine. One of da big ones — da bolt-thrower on da third tower. It hit da base of our ladder and da supply line broke. Da warriors on da parapet were cut off. Dey fought. Dey died."

Thokk said nothing. Thirty warriors on a parapet with no reinforcement. They would have known, in the last minutes, that no one was coming. That the ladder was gone and the wall was behind them and the humans were in front of them and the arithmetic had resolved.

Warriors of the Ironclaw. His people. Dead on a wall that was not theirs, for a war they had not chosen, because the hunting grounds had failed and the fish had thinned and the land was dying and the only path that led to next winter ran through a gate that would not break.

"Get yer wounded down," Thokk said. "Moonrise."

Krogan nodded. Left.

---

Gharza came with the western count and an argument.

"Twelve dead. Nine wounded."

Thokk looked at her. The western numbers were light — lighter than the east or the gate by a factor that said the western approach had been what he'd ordered it to be: pressure, not assault. Keep the defenders looking in two directions. Make them spread thin.

"Da sappers?"

"Underground. Skrixx says dey're making progress — da mining tunnels are partially collapsed but da goblins are clearing dem. He wants more supplies. More timber for shoring. More charges." She sat down without being invited, which was a thing Gharza did because Gharza believed that standing while someone else stood was a waste of energy and energy was currency. "He also wants to know why we're not using da Revenants."

"Because I said so."

"Dat's not an answer, Blood-Chief."

"It's da only one he's getting."

Gharza looked at him. The split jaw moved — the scar flexing as she worked her mouth, chewing on words she was deciding whether to spit or swallow.

"Da Revenants are five hundred bodies dat don't tire, don't bleed, don't need feeding. Dey're standing at da edge of camp doing nothing while our people die on dat wall."

"Our people are dying for a future. Da Revenants don't have a future. Dey don't have anything. Dey're dead things wearing weapons, and da moment I put dem in front, every orc in dis host starts asking what we're fighting for if da answer is *let da corpses do it.*"

Gharza was quiet for a moment. The fire crackled between them.

"Dat's politics."

"Dat's leadership."

"It's da same thing."

Thokk looked at the fire. She wasn't wrong. She was rarely wrong. That was the price of keeping her close — the truth arrived whether you'd invited it or not, and it sat down without asking.

"Da Revenants go in when da wall breaks. When da fighting is inside, where da orcs can see what dey're fighting beside. Not before. I'll spend orc blood to take dat wall because orc blood buys something — it buys da right to stand in dat city and call it ours. Dead things don't buy anything. Dey just add to da pile."

Gharza watched him.

"How many did we lose today, Blood-Chief? All told?"

Thokk had been doing the arithmetic since Malga's count. He did it again, because the numbers deserved the weight of repetition.

"One hundred and forty-two dead. Eighty-four wounded. Forty-one out of da fight."

The fire moved. The numbers sat in the air the way smoke sat — present, visible, impossible to grasp.

One hundred and forty-two. More than projected. He had told the War-Chiefs three hundred on the first day, but he'd meant that as the upper bound, the number that accounted for the worst case. The reality was that the first day's assault had not been a full commitment — the gate assault and the eastern push had been the primary efforts, the west had been pressure, and the Revenants had not moved. A partial assault, and it had cost him one hundred and forty-two warriors who would not eat next winter, would not see Bloodtide Bay again, would not hold their children or dance the victory dances or grow old in the camp by the shore.

One hundred and forty-two. And the wall still stood.

"Ya could lose one-forty a day for eight days before ya run out of Ironclaw," Gharza said. She had done the same math. She always did the same math. "Nine days if ya count da goblins. Twelve if ya count da Revenants."

"I know da numbers."

"I know ya know. I'm saying dem out loud because sometimes da math sounds different when someone else says it."

It didn't. It sounded the same. It sounded like a countdown.

"Go," Thokk said. "Moonrise."

Gharza rose. She moved with the deliberate economy of a woman who had learned to ration everything — movement, words, the energy it took to stand up and walk away from a fire when the fire was warm and the dark was cold.

She paused at the edge of the light.

"Da humans on dat wall, Blood-Chief. Dey're fighting like it's deir last day on earth."

"It might be."

"Might be ours too."

She left.

---

Urzag the Quiet sent a runner. His count: three dead, two wounded. The reserve had not engaged. The war-beasts were fed and rested.

Three words from Urzag, delivered by a runner who looked relieved to have been given so few to carry.

Thokk tallied the total.

Ironclaw losses: one hundred and forty-five dead. Eighty-six wounded. Forty-three unable to fight. Effective Ironclaw strength: one thousand and fifty-five, down from twelve hundred. Skrixx's goblins had lost separately — Thokk would get those numbers from the Pyrelord, eventually, when Skrixx finished recalibrating whatever engine had misfired and remembered that casualties were something commanders counted.

The Revenants stood at the edge of camp. Untouched. Five hundred dead things that did not diminish.

One thousand and fifty-five orcs. Against a garrison that had started at eight hundred and fifty and had lost — Thokk estimated, based on the bodies his warriors had stepped over — perhaps two hundred. Six hundred and fifty human defenders. Maybe more.

The ratio was narrowing. Not fast enough.

---

Skrixx came after dark.

The goblin moved through the orc camp like a stone skipping across water — fast, erratic, never touching any single point long enough to register weight. He was small even by goblin standards, wiry, his limbs too long for his body in the way of all goblins, as if the bones had been assembled by someone working from a description rather than a diagram. His skin was the mottled green-grey of cave lichen, and it was covered in burns — old burns, new burns, burns in various stages of healing that mapped his body like a record of every thing he'd ever built that had caught fire, which was most of them.

He smelled like smoke. He always smelled like smoke. It was not the clean smoke of a cook fire or the forge-smoke that hung over Emberfall. It was the sharp, acrid stink of alchemist's fire and the sulphurous bite of blasting powder and something underneath, something organic and wrong, the smell of a creature who lived so close to his own explosions that the residue had become part of his skin.

"Da Jawbreaker's arm cracked," Skrixx said, without greeting, without preamble, because goblins did not waste time on the social architecture that orcs considered necessary and humans considered civilised. "Stress fracture along da main timber. I can fix it. Need four hours and better wood."

"Yer losses."

Skrixx blinked. His eyes — too large, too bright, the colour of tarnished copper — moved in a rapid calculation that had nothing to do with the dead and everything to do with the operational capacity of his remaining equipment.

"Twenty-two sappers in da tunnels. Cave-in on da secondary approach — da humans sealed it wit something, mortar or packed stone, and my crews hit it wit charges and da ceiling came down. Fourteen dead, eight dug out. Six catapult crews lost to counter-fire from da wall — dey targeted my engine positions after da second volley. Dey're accurate, dose archers." He paused, not from grief but from the computational pause of a mind that processed death the way it processed structural failure: as a variable that altered the equation. "Total: thirty-one dead. Effective crew at seven hundred and sixty-nine."

Thirty-one goblins. Added to the Ironclaw losses, the day's total was one hundred and seventy-six dead.

"Da eastern bastion," Thokk said. "Malga says ya cracked da ward-work."

"Da rune matrix." Skrixx's voice shifted — the flat, transactional tone giving way to something that was, in a goblin, the closest thing to enthusiasm. "Da ward-work on da eastern bastion runs along a matrix — a lattice of old enchantment bonded to da stone. It's dwarf-work. Good dwarf-work. But it's finite — da enchantment stores power and da power depletes under sustained impact. I hit da same point wit six concentrated loads and da ward-light fractured. Da stone held. But da magic didn't."

"Can ya break it?"

"Da wards or da stone?"

"Both."

Skrixx grinned. It was not a reassuring expression. Too many teeth, arranged in a pattern that suggested the mouth had been designed for biting through things that were not meant to be bitten through.

"Da wards, yes. Two more days of concentrated bombardment on da eastern bastion and da rune matrix will be spent. Da stone —" He tilted his head. "Da stone I can break wit charges. Once da wards are down, da wall is just wall. Mortar and rock. Old. Patched. Weak at da joints." His fingers twitched — the constant, restless movement of a builder's hands, always reaching for something to adjust. "I need da sappers in da tunnels under da western section. Da mining shafts run close to da foundation — if my crews can clear da debris and set charges at da base, we can drop a section of wall from below while da bombardment takes da wards from above."

"Timeline."

"Two days for da tunnels. Two for da wards. Da wall comes down on day four." He paused. "Maybe day five. Da wood for da Jawbreaker—"

"Ya'll have yer wood. And yer sappers get priority on da western tunnels. But Skrixx—" Thokk leaned forward, and the firelight showed the full weight of his face — the scarred jaw, the heavy brow, the eyes that were too old for the body they lived in. "Ya lose any more crews to cave-ins and I'll send Gharza's warriors in to shore da tunnels before yer goblins go back in. Yer people are expendable to ya. Not to me."

Skrixx stared at him. The copper eyes blinked twice — the rapid, lizard-like flutter that goblins performed when processing something their worldview had not accommodated.

"Orcs," he said. "Shoring tunnels for goblins."

"Goblins are dying in my service. Dat makes dem mine."

Skrixx considered this for a moment that lasted longer than most goblin pauses, which was to say it lasted nearly two seconds. Then he nodded — a single, sharp jerk of his head, the goblin's version of agreement, delivered with the efficiency of a creature who had already moved on to the next calculation.

He vanished into the dark. The smoke-smell lingered.

---

Moonrise.

Thokk walked the camp.

He walked it alone, because the rites were his to perform and the dead were his to honour and the weight of one hundred and forty-five orc dead was not a thing he could delegate. Grimtusk had offered. The lesser shamans had prepared the pyres and the oils and the bone-ash paste that was used to mark the fallen. But Thokk had shaken his head, and Grimtusk had understood, because Grimtusk understood the old ways better than anyone alive and the old ways were clear on this:

When a Warlord's warriors fell, the Warlord walked among them.

The dead were laid in rows.

They filled the eastern slope of the ridge, below the command fire, arranged on the bare ground with their weapons beside them and their faces turned toward the sky. Ironclaw tradition demanded this — the dead faced upward so the spirits could find them, so the ancestors could look down from wherever ancestors went and see the faces of the children coming home. Their armour had been stripped. Not from disrespect — from necessity. The armour would be cleaned, repaired, given to the warriors who needed it. The dead did not need iron. The dead needed only the rites, the words, and the fire that would carry them to the place beyond.

One hundred and forty-five.

Thokk started at the first row.

The warrior's name was Grukk. Thokk knew this because he knew them — not all, not by sight, but by name, by warband, by the particular details that made each warrior a person rather than a number. Grukk had fought at Stonehaven. He had been one of the thirty who held the secondary breach when the dwarven counter-attack came through, and he had taken an axe across the shoulder that had never healed right, and for the rest of his life his right arm had not risen above his head without pain. He had fought today with that arm. He had died with it.

Thokk knelt.

He dipped his fingers into the bone-ash paste — the mixture of crushed ancestor bone and tallow and herbs that Grimtusk's apprentices had prepared in the copper bowls that the Ironclaw carried on every campaign. The paste was warm. It smelled of fat and old fire and something else, something that lived at the edge of perception, the faint, electrical charge of spiritual residue that meant the ancestors were present in the mixture, their ground bones carrying the last traces of the power that had animated them in life.

He drew the marks.

Three lines across the forehead: the mark of passage. One vertical, two crossing — the symbol that told the spirits this warrior was done, his fight was over, his obligations to the living were fulfilled. The lines were straight. The bone-ash was smooth. Thokk's hands were steady because steadiness was what the dead deserved. A shaking hand was an apology, and the dead did not need apologies. They needed certainty.

"Ya fought well," Thokk said.

Not a prayer. The Ironclaw did not pray. They spoke to their dead the way they spoke to their living — directly, without embellishment, because the spirits did not need poetry. They needed truth.

"Da wall didn't break today. It'll break tomorrow, or da day after. When it does, yer warband will be first through. Not because ya died — because ya fought, and da fight goes forward."

He touched the warrior's chest. Over the heart. The traditional gesture — the closed fist, pressed briefly against the sternum, the contact between living flesh and dead flesh that was the closest the Ironclaw came to tenderness.

"Go to da fire. Da ancestors are waiting."

He rose. Moved to the next.

---

It took hours.

One hundred and forty-five warriors. Each one marked. Each one spoken to. Each one given the fist over the heart, the words that were not the same for any two because the dead were not the same, because Grukk of Stonehaven was not Kira who had shattered her spine falling from the parapet and was not Drenn who had burned in the Throat's murder-oil and was not Hazga who had taken three arrows and walked thirty paces before her legs understood what the arrows meant.

Some of them Thokk had known well. War-Chief Krogan's eldest son, a boy of twenty-two who had fought beside his father on the eastern wall and died when the ladder broke and dropped him forty feet onto the stone below. Thokk marked the boy's forehead with the three lines and spoke the words and the words tasted like ash because Krogan had stood behind his son's body while Thokk prepared the paste, and neither of them had spoken, and the silence between them was the heaviest thing on the ridge.

Some of them Thokk had not known at all. New recruits from the shore camps — young warriors who had joined the march because the alternative was watching their families starve, and who had died on a wall they'd never seen before today, in a city whose name they couldn't pronounce. He marked them anyway. Spoke to them anyway. Learned their names from the warriors who carried them, and used the names in the rites, because a name was the minimum that the dead were owed.

He did not rush.

The moon climbed. The camp was quiet — not silent, because a war camp was never silent, but the noise had shifted from the industrial clatter of preparation to the low, subdued hum of people who had fought and bled and survived and were now sitting in the dark trying to decide whether surviving was the same as winning.

The pyres were built behind the ridge. Wood and oil, the traditional construction — a platform of stacked timber, high enough that the flames would reach above the treeline, visible to anyone watching from the walls of Emberfall. The humans would see the smoke. They would know what it meant. Every army burned its dead, regardless of species or faith, because the alternative was disease and the practical demands of hygiene trumped the spiritual significance of fire.

But for the Ironclaw, the fire was not practical. The fire was passage. The smoke carried the spirit. The flames burned the body clean so that what rose from the ash was the essential thing — the warrior, stripped of flesh and bone, freed from the weight of the body that had carried them through however many years the world had given them. The ancestors would receive the smoke. The spirits would breathe it in. And somewhere, in the place where the dead waited, one hundred and forty-five new voices would join the chorus that Grimtusk listened to when he cast the bones.

Or they wouldn't. Because the spirits were confused, and the bones were quiet, and the old connections were thinning like roots in bad soil.

Thokk marked the last warrior.

He stood.

His knees ached. His hands were stained with the bone-ash paste — grey-white against the grey-green of his skin, the residue of ancestor bone ground into the lines of his palms like an accusation. His back was tight from the hours of kneeling, and his eyes stung from the smoke, and his chest held the particular weight that came from speaking to one hundred and forty-five dead warriors who could not answer.

He looked at the rows.

They lay in the moonlight. The bone-ash marks on their foreheads caught the light and held it — three lines, repeated one hundred and forty-five times, a pattern that stretched across the slope like a message written in a language the living could read but only the dead could understand.

His people. His warriors. The cost of the first day.

---

"Da spirits are restless."

Grimtusk's voice came from behind him. The old shaman had approached without sound — a feat that should have been impossible given his age and his weight, but Grimtusk moved through the world the way spirits moved: by being present in a place before anyone noticed he'd arrived.

Thokk did not turn.

"Restless how?"

"Different from yesterday." Grimtusk moved to stand beside him. The copper-capped tusks glinted in the moonlight. His milky grey eyes were fixed on the rows of dead, but Thokk knew from long experience that Grimtusk's eyes saw differently than other eyes — the grey was not blindness but a different kind of sight, one that registered things the physical world kept hidden. "Yesterday dey were confused. Like smoke in wind. Tonight dey're—" He searched for the word. "Agitated. Dey can feel da dead. Dis many dying dis close to da camp — da spirits smell it. Da blood, da fear, da passage. It wakes dem up."

"Good. Den dey can tell us something useful."

"I read da bones again."

Thokk waited.

"Same blood. Same confusion. Da pattern hasn't changed — da blood flows in every direction, da ground drinks it. But dere's something new." Grimtusk reached into the leather pouch at his belt and withdrew a wolf knuckle — a single bone, cracked along its length, the fracture running in a jagged line from one end to the other. "Dis broke during da casting. Da heat split it."

"What does dat mean?"

"Bones don't break in a war-reading. Not like dis. Da heat comes from da spirits, from da energy dey pour into da casting when dey have something to say. Dis bone broke because da spirits pushed too hard. Dey're trying to tell me something and da channel isn't wide enough for what dey want to say."

Thokk looked at the cracked bone. It was small — smaller than his thumbnail, the fragment of a wolf's joint worn smooth by years of casting, the surface dark with the oils of a hundred readings. The crack ran through it like a fault line through rock.

"Da number," Grimtusk said. "Seven. It's still dere. Every reading. Every casting. Seven. But now dere's something else — a weight behind it. Like da number has a shape. A shadow. Something attached to it dat da bones can't show me because da connection between da spirits and da living world is—"

"Thinning."

"Yes."

They stood together in the moonlight, watching the dead. The pyres behind the ridge were ready — Thokk could smell the oil, the sharp, resinous scent of pitch-soaked timber waiting for the spark.

"Can ya still perform da passage rites?"

"Yes. Da spirits are restless, not gone. Dey'll receive da dead. Dey want to receive da dead — dat's part of da agitation. Dey can feel da souls pressing against da barrier between da worlds, and da barrier is—"

"Thinning."

"You keep saying dat word."

"Because ya keep describing it."

Grimtusk was quiet for a moment. The copper on his tusks caught the firelight from the command fire above and the moonlight from above that, and for a moment his face was a map of two different lights, two different sources, each one illuminating a different landscape of scar and line and age.

"Something is changing, Blood-Chief. In da deep places. Da world dat holds da spirits, da world dat connects da living to da ancestors — it's not what it was. I've been a War-Shaman for forty years. I've read da bones in six campaigns, at da deaths of three Warlords, at da birth of a hundred warriors. Da spirits have always spoken. Not always clearly, not always kindly, but dey spoke. Now—" He held up the cracked bone. "Now dey're screaming through a crack in a door dat's closing."

Thokk took the bone from him. Held it. It weighed nothing.

"Will da rites hold?"

"For now."

"Den for now is enough." Thokk placed the cracked bone in the leather pouch at his own belt, next to the skull of the old Warlord. A wolf knuckle beside a dead chief's skull. The weight of what came before and the weight of what was coming.

"Light da pyres."

---

The fire rose.

It climbed the night in a column of orange and gold and the deeper red that came from the oil, and the smoke that rose from it was thick and dark and carried with it the smell of everything the fire was consuming — wood, oil, bone, flesh, the hundred and forty-five warriors of the Ironclaw who had died today on a wall that had not broken.

Thokk watched.

The warband watched with him. Not standing at attention — the Ironclaw did not form ranks for their dead the way humans did. They gathered. They came in ones and twos and small groups, drifting toward the fire the way water drifts downhill, drawn by the heat and the light and the fundamental, orcish need to witness. To see. To know that the fire was real and the dead were in it and the passage was happening.

Grimtusk stood at the pyre's base and spoke the old words. The language was not Common — it was the orcish of the deep past, the tongue the ancestors had spoken before the humans came and the trade-talk smoothed the edges off everything. The words were guttural, rhythmic, rising and falling in a cadence that was not song and not speech but something between — the sound of a shaman calling to the spirits through a connection that was older than writing and more fragile than either of them wanted to admit.

The fire answered.

Not visibly — not in the way that human magic answered, with light and colour and the theatrical displays that the War-Mages on the Veilfire Spire seemed to favour. The fire answered in the way fires had always answered: by burning higher, burning hotter, the flames leaning toward the shaman's voice as if listening, the heat pressing against the faces of the living with a weight that was not purely physical.

Thokk felt it. The warmth on his skin was the warmth of the pyre, but beneath it was something else — the faint, electrical presence of the spirits, the ancestor-weight that sat in the fire and breathed through the smoke and was, for a moment, tangible. Real. The old connections, thinning as they were, holding long enough for the passage to happen.

He watched his dead rise.

Not their bodies. Their smoke. The column climbed the dark, spreading as it went, thinning at the edges the way Grimtusk said the spiritual connections were thinning — fraying, losing coherence, the boundary between the smoke that was smoke and the smoke that was something more growing less distinct with every foot of altitude.

One hundred and forty-five warriors. Fathers. Mothers. Sons. Daughters. People who had left Bloodtide Bay with the understanding that some of them would not return, and who had marched anyway because the alternative was staying behind and watching the children grow thinner through the winter until the growing stopped entirely.

Thokk had sent them to the wall.

That was the weight. Not the death — death was the currency of war, and every warrior in the Ironclaw understood the exchange rate. The weight was the sending. The decision. The moment in the firelight when he had said *tomorrow, we hit dem at first light* and one hundred and forty-five people who trusted him had walked into a killing ground because he told them to.

The smoke climbed. The fire burned. Grimtusk's voice rose and fell.

Thokk looked across the valley at Emberfall.

The city was burning. Not the catastrophic, consuming fire of a city being destroyed, but the smaller, scattered fires of a city at war — the siege damage, the alchemist's fire that refused to go out, the forge-haze thickened by smoke from impacts and collapsed buildings. Orange light flickered through the outer ring like a heartbeat, irregular and constant, the dying pulse of a district that had spent the day absorbing the blows his warriors had delivered.

Behind those walls, the human commander was doing what Thokk was doing. Counting his dead. Measuring the cost against what remained. Running the arithmetic of attrition and arriving at a number that did not add up to survival.

Thokk knew this because the math was the same on both sides of a wall. It was always the same. The only thing that changed was the names.

He thought about the defenders he had watched from the ridge. Through the smoke, through the haze, he could not see individuals — only the shapes of resistance. The line on the wall that bent but did not break. The archers on the bastions whose discipline turned the Veil's Throat into a slaughter. The leader on the rampart — a shape, a figure, standing where commanders stood, making the decisions that commanders made.

That man had lost two hundred of his people today. Maybe more. He would stand on his wall tonight and look at the ridge and see the Ironclaw's funeral pyres and know what they meant — that the enemy was burying its dead and preparing for tomorrow, that the siege would continue, that the arithmetic would grind on until one side reached zero.

Two leaders. Two sides of a wall. Both burning their dead and counting their living and trying to calculate whether the living would last longer than the wall.

Thokk understood the human commander. He did not hate him. He did not respect him in the way that songs described — the noble enemy, the worthy foe, the language of warriors who had never fought a war of survival and could afford to dress the killing in poetry.

He understood him.

That was worse.

---

The fire burned low.

The warriors dispersed — back to their camps, their cook fires, the animal-skin bedrolls where they would sleep or not sleep, waiting for the dawn that would bring the next assault and the next count. The shamans collected the bone-ash residue from the pyres, because the ash of the honoured dead had spiritual value, and the tradition demanded that it be gathered and stored and eventually returned to Bloodtide Bay, to the shore where the Ironclaw buried their ancestors in the sand and let the tide carry the last of them out to the deep water.

Thokk stood at the dying fire.

The cracked wolf knuckle sat in the pouch beside the old Warlord's skull. He could feel both of them — the bone and the bone, the dead shaman's tool and the dead chief's crown, the two weights that sat against his hip and pulled at him in ways that were not physical.

Seven.

The number Grimtusk had spoken last night. The number the spirits insisted on, pushing it through a connection that was cracking, screaming it through a door that was closing. Seven strikes. Seven blows. Seven of something that the bones could show but could not explain.

Thokk did not believe in omens. He believed in the spirits — he had felt them tonight, in the fire, in the passage rites, in the weight of ancestor-presence that pressed against the living world like a hand against glass. The spirits were real. The old connections were real. But omens were interpretation, and interpretation was a human habit, the impulse to read meaning into pattern and call it prophecy.

Seven was a number. Numbers did not have shadows. Numbers did not carry weight.

But the wolf knuckle had cracked.

He touched the pouch. Felt the fractured bone against the smooth curve of the skull. Two dead things, carried by a living man who was sending living men to die. The chain of Warlords — skull to skull to skull, each one carried by the leader who had earned it and would one day become it.

He wondered which skull would carry his.

The fire died to coals. The smoke thinned. The valley between the ridge and the city lay in darkness, the two camps — orc and human — visible only by their fires, two constellations of light separated by the wall and the killing ground and the mathematics of blood that neither side could afford and neither side could stop.

Tomorrow the wall would bleed again. His people would bleed. The humans would bleed. And Thokk would stand on the ridge and give the orders and count the dead and walk among them at moonrise and speak to them the way he spoke to the living — directly, without embellishment, because the dead deserved honesty and the living did too, and the line between the two was getting thinner.

Like roots in bad soil.

He turned from the pyre.

Walked up the ridge to the command fire.

Sat.

And waited for dawn.
