# CHAPTER EIGHT: THE BONES SPEAK

## Day 2 — After the First Assault

---

The dead came back in numbers.

They arrived in fragments throughout the evening — carried by runners, by War-Chiefs, by the drawn silence of warriors who had spent the day dying and were now required to count how many had succeeded. Thokk stood at the command fire and received each count the way a man receives blows in a fight he cannot leave.

Malga came first.

She climbed the ridge with the heavy stride of a woman whose body was intact but whose warband was not. Her left arm was bandaged — tight, crude, one-handed. The blood had soaked through in a bloom that looked black in the firelight.

"Forty-seven dead. Thirty-one wounded who'll fight tomorrow. Nineteen who won't."

The vanguard had been three hundred. Effective strength: two hundred and thirty-four.

A fifth of its strength, hitting a gate that hadn't opened.

"Da gate?"

"Standing." Malga said the word flat, without cushion. "Da rune-wards pushed back every ram strike. We got close — da third crew nearly set breach charges before da archers took dem. But da wards flare and da rams bounce and ya can't set a charge on a surface dat won't let ya touch it."

"How many ram crews?"

"Four. Lost two complete in da Throat." The fire moved across her face, showing the scar where her ear had been. "Da Throat is a killing ground, Blood-Chief. Fifty feet wide, walls on both sides, murder holes above. Oil. Arrows. Nowhere to go except forward into a gate dat won't break."

"It'll break."

"Not wit rams. Not while da wards hold."

"Da bombardment?"

"Skrixx's engines cracked da eastern bastion. I saw da ward-light flicker — da rune-work is damaged on dat side. He hit da same spot six, seven times. Da stone held but da magic didn't."

Something. Not enough.

"Get yer wounded to da shamans. Rites at moonrise."

Malga nodded. Turned. Stopped.

"Thokk."

He waited.

"Da humans in dat Throat. Dey fight like dey've got nowhere to go."

"Dey don't."

She looked at him. Whatever she saw, she did not comment on it. She walked down the ridge, and the darkness took her.

---

Krogan brought the eastern numbers. Blood had dried from temple to jaw, following the groove of an old scar.

"Sixty-three dead. Forty-four wounded. Twenty-two out."

Worse. Krogan's eastern assault had been three hundred warriors hitting the breach point — the patch, the place where the stone was different and the mortar was new and the humans knew it was vulnerable.

"Da breach?"

"We got on da parapet twice." Krogan's voice carried the weight of a man describing something he'd seen from close enough to taste. "First time, ladders held eleven minutes. Got thirty warriors up. Da Ironborn pushed dem back — heavy infantry, Blood-Chief. Armoured. Disciplined. Dey fight like da wall is part of deir body."

"And da second time?"

"Longer. Long enough I thought we had it. Long enough da warriors behind me started pushing forward because dey could feel da line bending." He paused. "Den dey redirected a bolt-thrower. Hit da base of our ladder and da supply line broke. Da warriors on da parapet were cut off."

Thirty warriors on a parapet with no reinforcement. They would have known, in the last minutes, that no one was coming.

"Get yer wounded down. Moonrise."

Krogan nodded. Left.

---

Gharza came with the western count and an argument.

"Twelve dead. Nine wounded."

Light numbers. The western approach had been what he'd ordered: pressure, not assault.

"Da sappers?"

"Underground. Skrixx says dey're making progress. He wants more supplies, more timber, more charges." She sat without being invited, because Gharza believed standing while someone else stood was a waste of energy and energy was currency. "He also wants to know why we're not using da Revenants."

"Because I said so."

"Dat's not an answer, Blood-Chief."

"It's da only one he's getting."

The split jaw flexed as she chewed on words she was deciding whether to spit or swallow.

"Da Revenants are five hundred bodies dat don't tire, don't bleed, don't need feeding. Dey're standing at da edge of camp doing nothing while our people die on dat wall."

"Our people are dying for a future. Da Revenants don't have a future. Dey don't have anything. Dey're dead things wearing weapons, and da moment I put dem in front, every orc in dis host starts asking what we're fighting for if da answer is *let da corpses do it.*"

Gharza was quiet. The fire crackled between them.

"Dat's politics."

"Dat's leadership."

"It's da same thing."

She wasn't wrong. That was the price of keeping her close — the truth arrived whether you'd invited it or not.

"Da Revenants go in when da wall breaks. When da fighting is inside, where da orcs can see what dey're fighting beside. Not before."

She watched him.

"How many did we lose today? All told?"

"One hundred and forty-two dead. Eighty-four wounded. Forty-one out of da fight."

The numbers sat in the air like smoke.

"Ya could lose one-forty a day for eight days before ya run out of Ironclaw," Gharza said. "Nine if ya count da goblins. Twelve if ya count da Revenants."

"I know da numbers."

"I know ya know. I'm saying dem out loud because sometimes da math sounds different when someone else says it."

It didn't.

"Go. Moonrise."

She paused at the edge of the light.

"Da humans on dat wall. Dey're fighting like it's deir last day on earth."

"Might be ours too."

She left.

---

Skrixx came after dark.

The goblin moved through the orc camp like a stone skipping across water — fast, erratic, never touching any point long enough to register weight. His skin was mottled green-grey, covered in burns at various stages of healing that mapped every thing he'd ever built that had caught fire. He smelled like smoke — not cook-fire smoke. The sharp, acrid stink of alchemist's fire and blasting powder and something organic underneath.

"Da Jawbreaker's arm cracked," he said, without greeting. "Stress fracture. I can fix it. Need four hours and better wood."

"Yer losses."

Skrixx blinked. The copper eyes moved in a calculation that had nothing to do with the dead and everything to do with remaining equipment.

"Twenty-two sappers in da tunnels — cave-in on da secondary approach, fourteen dead, eight dug out. Six catapult crews lost to counter-fire." He paused the way a mind paused when processing death as structural failure. "Total: thirty-one dead. Effective crew at seven hundred and sixty-nine."

One hundred and seventy-six dead total.

"Da eastern bastion," Thokk said. "Malga says ya cracked da ward-work."

"Da rune matrix." Skrixx's tone shifted to something that was, in a goblin, enthusiasm. "Dwarf-work. Good dwarf-work. But finite — da enchantment stores power and depletes under sustained impact. I hit da same point wit six concentrated loads and da ward-light fractured. Da stone held. Da magic didn't."

"Can ya break it?"

"Da wards or da stone?"

"Both."

Skrixx grinned. Too many teeth.

"Da wards, two more days of bombardment. Da stone — once da wards are down, it's just wall. Mortar and rock. Old. Patched. Weak at da joints." His fingers twitched, restless. "I need da sappers in da western tunnels. Da mining shafts run close to da foundation. Charges at da base, bombardment from above. Da wall comes down on day four. Maybe five."

"Ya'll have yer wood. And yer sappers get priority." Thokk leaned forward. "But Skrixx — ya lose any more crews to cave-ins and I'll send Gharza's warriors to shore da tunnels before yer goblins go back in."

Skrixx stared. The copper eyes blinked twice — the rapid flutter goblins performed when processing something their worldview had not accommodated.

"Orcs. Shoring tunnels for goblins."

"Goblins are dying in my service. Dat makes dem mine."

Skrixx considered this for nearly two seconds. Then a single, sharp nod — agreement delivered with the efficiency of a creature already calculating the next variable.

He vanished into the dark. The smoke-smell lingered.

---

Moonrise.

Thokk walked the camp alone.

Grimtusk had offered. The lesser shamans had prepared the pyres and the oils and the bone-ash paste. But the old ways were clear: when a Warlord's warriors fell, the Warlord walked among them.

The dead were laid in rows on the eastern slope. One hundred and forty-five. Weapons beside them. Faces turned toward the sky so the spirits could find them. Their armour had been stripped — not from disrespect but necessity. The dead needed only the rites, the words, and the fire.

Thokk started at the first row.

The warrior's name was Grukk. He had fought at Stonehaven — one of the thirty who held the secondary breach when the dwarven counter-attack came through. He had taken an axe across the shoulder that never healed right. He had fought today with that arm. He had died with it.

Thokk knelt. Dipped his fingers into the bone-ash paste — crushed ancestor bone, tallow, herbs. The paste was warm. It smelled of fat and old fire.

Three lines across the forehead. The mark of passage.

"Ya fought well."

Not a prayer. The Ironclaw did not pray. They spoke to their dead directly, because the spirits did not need poetry. They needed truth.

"Da wall didn't break today. It'll break tomorrow, or da day after. When it does, yer warband will be first through."

He touched the warrior's chest. Over the heart. Closed fist, pressed briefly. The closest the Ironclaw came to tenderness.

"Go to da fire. Da ancestors are waiting."

He rose. Moved to the next.

---

One hundred and forty-five warriors. Each one marked. Each one spoken to. Each one given the fist over the heart and words that were not the same for any two, because the dead were not the same. Grukk of Stonehaven was not Kira who had shattered her spine falling from the parapet. Not Drenn who had burned in the Throat's murder-oil. Not Hazga who had taken three arrows and walked thirty paces before her legs understood what the arrows meant.

Some he had known well. Krogan's eldest son — twenty-two, died when the ladder broke and dropped him forty feet. Thokk marked the boy's forehead while Krogan stood behind the body, and neither of them spoke, and the silence was the heaviest thing on the ridge.

Some he had not known at all. Young warriors from the shore camps who had joined because the alternative was watching their families starve. He learned their names from the warriors who carried them, and used the names, because a name was the minimum the dead were owed.

The moon climbed. The camp settled into the low hum of people trying to decide whether surviving was the same as winning.

Thokk marked the last warrior. Stood. His knees ached. His hands were grey-white with bone-ash, the residue ground into the lines of his palms.

---

"Da spirits are restless."

Grimtusk's voice came from behind him. The old shaman had arrived without sound — a feat that should have been impossible given his age.

Thokk did not turn. "Restless how?"

"Different from yesterday. Yesterday dey were confused. Tonight dey're agitated. Dey can feel da dead — dis many dying dis close wakes dem up." He moved to stand beside Thokk. The copper-capped tusks glinted. "I read da bones again."

Thokk waited.

"Same blood. Same confusion. But dere's something new." Grimtusk withdrew a wolf knuckle from the leather pouch at his belt — a single bone, cracked along its length. "Dis broke during da casting. Da heat split it."

"What does dat mean?"

"Bones don't break in a war-reading. Da heat comes from da spirits when dey have something to say. Dis bone broke because da spirits pushed too hard. Dey're trying to tell me something and da channel isn't wide enough."

Thokk looked at the cracked bone. Small. Worn smooth by years of casting. The crack ran through it like a fault line.

"Da number," Grimtusk said. "Seven. Every reading. But now dere's something behind it. A weight. A shadow. Something da bones can't show me because da connection is—"

"Thinning."

"Yes."

They stood together watching the dead. The pyres behind the ridge were ready — Thokk could smell the pitch.

"Can ya still perform da passage rites?"

"Da spirits are restless, not gone. Dey'll receive da dead."

"Den light da pyres."

---

The fire climbed the night.

Grimtusk stood at the base and spoke the old words — the orcish of the deep past, guttural, rhythmic, not song and not speech but something between. The sound of a shaman calling through a connection older than writing and more fragile than either of them wanted to admit.

The warband gathered. Not in ranks — the Ironclaw did not form ranks for their dead. They came in ones and twos, drawn by the heat and the fundamental need to witness.

Thokk felt it. The warmth of the pyre, and beneath it something else — the faint presence of the spirits, the ancestor-weight that breathed through the smoke and was, for a moment, real. The old connections, thinning, holding long enough for the passage to happen.

The smoke climbed. One hundred and forty-five warriors. Fathers. Mothers. Sons. Daughters. People who had left Bloodtide Bay understanding some would not return, and who had marched anyway because the alternative was watching the children grow thinner until the growing stopped.

Thokk had sent them to the wall. That was the weight. Not the death — death was the currency of war. The weight was the sending. The decision. The moment he had said *tomorrow, we hit dem at first light* and one hundred and forty-five people who trusted him had walked into a killing ground because he told them to.

He looked across the valley at Emberfall.

The city was burning. Not the consuming fire of destruction — the scattered, irregular fires of a city at war. Orange light flickered through the outer ring like a dying pulse.

Behind those walls, the human commander was doing what Thokk was doing. Counting his dead. Running the arithmetic. Arriving at a number that did not add up to survival.

Two leaders. Two sides of a wall. Both burning their dead and counting their living and trying to calculate whether the living would last longer than the wall.

Thokk did not hate the human commander. He understood him.

That was worse.

---

The fire burned low. The warriors dispersed. The shamans collected the bone-ash residue — tradition demanded it be returned to Bloodtide Bay, to the shore where the Ironclaw buried their ancestors in the sand and let the tide carry them out.

Thokk stood at the dying fire.

The cracked wolf knuckle sat in the pouch beside the old Warlord's skull. He could feel both — the bone and the bone, the dead shaman's tool and the dead chief's crown.

Seven. The number Grimtusk kept finding. Pushed through a connection that was cracking, screamed through a door that was closing. Seven strikes. Seven blows. Seven of something the bones could show but could not explain.

Thokk did not believe in omens. He believed in the spirits — he had felt them tonight, in the fire, in the weight of ancestor-presence pressing against the living world. The spirits were real. But omens were interpretation, and interpretation was a human habit.

Seven was a number.

But the wolf knuckle had cracked.

He touched the pouch. Two dead things, carried by a living man sending living men to die. The chain of Warlords — skull to skull, each one carried by the leader who had earned it and would one day become it.

He wondered which skull would carry his.

The fire died to coals. The valley lay in darkness, the two camps visible only by their fires — two constellations separated by the wall and the mathematics of blood.

Tomorrow the wall would bleed again. His people would bleed. And Thokk would stand on the ridge and give the orders and count the dead and walk among them at moonrise and speak to them the way he spoke to the living — directly, without embellishment, because the dead deserved honesty and the line between the living and the dead was getting thinner.

Like roots in bad soil.

He turned from the pyre. Walked up the ridge. Sat.

And waited for dawn.
