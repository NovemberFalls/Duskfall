# PROLOGUE: THE ANVIL

## Six Months Before the Siege

---

The fire started at the third bell.

Stoneveil had given the order at the second. One bell for the oil. One bell for the men to clear the perimeter. Then the third — and the Anvil District began to burn.

He stood on the wall above Forge Road, hands clasped behind his back, and watched the incendiaries arc through the smoke-choked air. Glass spheres filled with rendered tallow and alchemist's pitch, trailing thin ribbons of flame as they tumbled end over end into the barricades below. Each one burst on impact with a sound like a man clapping his hands once — sharp, flat, final.

The barricades went up first. Good material — forge carts, iron slabs, thick wooden doors ripped from the Smelter's Row shopfronts. But everything burns if you feed it enough.

The rebels behind them scrambled. Dark shapes against the light, moving the way people move when they realize they are standing in something they cannot outrun.

Some of them were carrying weapons. Hammers. Tongs. The crude pike-hafted things that smiths make when they decide to stop forging horseshoes and start forging a rebellion.

Some of them were not carrying anything at all.

Stoneveil noted this. Filed it. Moved on.

"Warden." Captain Harren, at his elbow. Soot on the man's face. "The eastern approach is sealed. Sergeant Morrow's company has the tunnel exits blocked."

"The western?"

"Holding. Some tried to break through toward the Ashen Market. Ironborn pushed them back."

"Casualties?"

"Ours? Six wounded. One critical — took a piece of slag across the neck."

Stoneveil nodded. "And theirs?"

Harren hesitated. A quarter-breath. "Unclear, sir. The fires are — it's difficult to get a count."

"Estimate."

"Three hundred. Maybe more. Hard to tell the dead from the ones who've stopped moving."

"Those are different things, Captain."

"Yes, sir."

Stoneveil looked back at the Anvil. The fires had spread to the buildings on either side of Forge Road — the lesser smithies, the tool shops, the cramped apartments above them where forge workers slept in shifts. Black smoke poured upward in a column so thick it looked solid, blotting out the sky.

Somewhere in that darkness, a forge bell was ringing. Not an alarm — the mechanism had warped in the heat, the clapper swinging free in an arrhythmic stutter. It would ring until the tower collapsed.

"Where is Blackhand?" Stoneveil asked.

"Still in the Black Anvil." Harren pointed, though the gesture was unnecessary. The main forge sat at the heart of the district like a fist of iron and stone, its chimney stacks belching smoke blacker than the rest. "He sealed the doors. Our sappers tried the tunnels but the rebels rigged the furnaces. We lost four men."

"How many inside?"

"Intelligence says two hundred. Maybe two-fifty. The core."

Two hundred men in a forge. Stoneveil studied the building — squat, heavy, dwarven-style, walls three feet thick, foundation sunk into bedrock. Blackhand had chosen his ground well.

He could starve them out. Seal the entrances, cut the water, wait. Three days, maybe four. The patient option.

Lord Commander Blackthorn's orders had been specific. *Crush it. Quickly. Before the orcs hear that our own people are killing each other and decide to test the walls while the garrison is split.*

So Stoneveil did the math.

Two hundred rebels in a sealed forge. Tunnel entrances trapped. Walls too thick for rams. A frontal assault would cost him fifty men fighting through chokepoints where smiths had turned their knowledge of metalwork into killing machines — molten slag channeled through sluice-gates, forge-hammers on pivot arms that could crush a man through plate.

"Captain."

"Sir."

"Redirect the incendiaries. Concentrate fire on the Black Anvil. All of it."

Harren's face went through something. He opened his mouth. Closed it.

"Sir, there are — intelligence suggests there may be noncombatants inside. Forge workers who didn't take up arms. Apprentices. Some of the smiths had their families —"

"I read the intelligence report, Captain."

"Yes, sir."

"And I gave an order."

The silence lasted three heartbeats. Stoneveil counted them — a habit from Ashgate, where he had learned that the pauses between orders were where men decided what kind of soldiers they were going to be.

"Yes, sir."

Harren turned and walked down the wall. His steps were steady. His back was straight. He did not look at Stoneveil again.

---

The Black Anvil burned differently than the barricades.

The incendiaries hit the roof first — chimney stacks cracking apart, showers of brick and hot iron cascading down the flanks. Then the pitch found the ventilation channels and poured down into the heart of the building like water finding a drain.

The fire went inward. The screaming started a moment later.

Stoneveil knew the sound. He had catalogued its variations across a career that had lasted thirty years — the high shriek of sudden pain, the grinding moan of a wound that won't stop, and the worst one, the hitching gasps of a person who has stopped hoping for rescue and is merely expressing the fact of their dying.

The Black Anvil produced all three.

The forge had been burning for sixty years. The incendiaries didn't start a fire so much as feed one that had never gone out. The crucible — the great iron bowl where the dwarves smelted their finest steel — cracked under the thermal shock. Molten slag erupted through the floor grates and poured into the lower chambers where, according to the intelligence reports Stoneveil had read and committed to memory and was now deliberately not thinking about, approximately forty noncombatants had taken shelter.

From below, there were no words.

Stoneveil stood on the wall and watched the Black Anvil die.

The roof went first — a section near the central stack folding inward with a groan of tortured metal and an eruption of sparks fifty feet high. Through the gap, he could see the interior — the great forge-hall, the catwalks, the shapes of men moving through the smoke like figures in a fever dream.

One of them was still at the forge.

A silhouette against the white-hot glow of the crucible's remains. A broad figure, shorter than the men around him, standing at the anvil with a hammer in his hand. Not fighting. Not running. Standing at his forge the way he had stood at it every day for forty years, because that was where a smith belonged and Drelgar Blackhand had never been anything but a smith — even when they called him Forge-King, even when they called him rebel, even when they called him dead.

The dwarf raised the hammer.

Stoneveil watched him bring it down.

The sound was eaten by the fire. But Stoneveil saw the hammer fall and the arm rise and the hammer fall again, and he understood that Blackhand was not making a weapon and he was not making a statement.

He was finishing his work.

A section of catwalk collapsed. The hammer rose one more time. Then the far wall buckled inward and the silhouette was gone.

Stoneveil stood still. Sparks drifted past him on the updraft — tiny, orange-red flecks that winked out one by one as they met the cooler air.

He did not look away. That was the rule he had set for himself at Ashgate: you watch what you order.

The screaming thinned. A voice here. A voice there. The forge bell struck slower, the mechanism failing.

Then the bell stopped.

Then the voices stopped.

The fire continued. It would burn for another six hours before the cleanup crews moved in. By morning, the number would reach Stoneveil's desk: 912 confirmed dead. Forty-three of the dead were under the age of sixteen. That number would be in the report too, in a smaller font, in a column that did not have a heading.

"Warden."

Lieutenant Daskell. Young. Efficient. Standing three paces back — the distance men had learned to keep when Stoneveil was watching something burn.

"The district is contained, sir. Captain Harren reports the perimeters are holding. No breakouts. Tunnel exits confirmed sealed."

"Survivors?"

"Some. Maybe two hundred made it out through the sewers before we got them blocked."

"Post sentries at the exits. Let the fires die. We'll sweep at dawn."

"Yes, sir." Daskell paused. "Lord Commander Blackthorn's aide has sent word. The Lord Commander requests your assessment for the Council session at first light."

"Tell the Lord Commander the Black Anvil Revolt is over. The district is secured. Casualties will be reported when the count is complete."

"And the Forge-King?"

"Dead."

Daskell waited. Stoneveil looked at him. Behind the lieutenant, the Anvil District was smoke and dying flame and shapes that had been buildings. The air smelled of pitch and hot iron and something sweeter that Stoneveil recognized and would not name.

"Is there anything else, Lieutenant?"

"No, sir."

"Then return to your post."

Daskell saluted and walked away. His boots made a precise, measured sound on the wall's stone surface.

Stoneveil turned back to the fire.

---

He stood there for a long time.

The last flames were dying when he unclasped his hands from behind his back. His fingers were stiff. He flexed them — once, twice. A small, private motion that no one saw.

He descended the stairs. At the bottom, a runner was waiting. Fourteen, maybe fifteen. Face pale beneath soot, hands trembling around a message scroll. He had been close enough to hear the things that happened inside the things that burned.

Stoneveil took the scroll. Broke the seal.

Scout reports from the northern watchtowers. Ironclaw movement along the ridgeline. War-parties massing. The assessment used the word *unprecedented* twice.

Six months. Maybe less.

He looked at the runner. The boy was staring past him toward the glow and the smoke and the silence where nine hundred people had been alive an hour ago.

"Eyes forward, son."

The boy snapped to attention. Jaw clenched so tight the muscles stood out like cords. He was fourteen. He smelled like smoke.

"Return to the command post. Tell Captain Harren I want casualty estimates on my desk by the fourth bell."

"Yes — yes, sir."

The boy ran.

Stoneveil stood alone at the base of the wall. Above him, amber and black where the smoke pressed against the clouds. Somewhere in the wreckage, a beam collapsed with a sound like a bone snapping.

He had given the order. It was the correct order.

He would not think about the forty-three. Not tonight, not tomorrow, not in the weeks that followed as the cleanup crews pulled bodies from the rubble and the Council praised his efficiency.

He would not think about them until six months later, when the siege forced him back into the Anvil District — into the same ruins, the same streets, the same burned-out shell of the Black Anvil forge — and he stood in the exact spot where Blackhand had raised his hammer for the last time, and the forty-three were finally, impossibly, all he could think about.

But that was later.

Now, Stoneveil walked toward the command post and began composing in his mind the report he would deliver at first light.

The language came easily. It always did.
