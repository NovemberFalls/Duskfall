# PROLOGUE: THE ANVIL

## Six Months Before the Siege

---

The fire started at the third bell.

Stoneveil had given the order at the second. One bell for the oil. One bell for the men to clear the perimeter. Then the third — and the Anvil District began to burn.

He stood on the wall above Forge Road, hands clasped behind his back, and watched the incendiaries arc through the smoke-choked air. They were beautiful, in a way he did not allow himself to think about. Glass spheres filled with rendered tallow and alchemist's pitch, trailing thin ribbons of flame as they tumbled end over end into the barricades below. Each one burst on impact with a sound like a man clapping his hands once — sharp, flat, final.

The barricades went up first. The rebels had built them from forge carts, iron slabs, and the thick wooden doors ripped from the Smelter's Row shopfronts. Good material. Sturdy. But everything burns if you feed it enough.

Stoneveil counted the impacts. Seven. Twelve. Nineteen. Each one a blossom of yellow-white heat that ate into wood and metal alike, the alchemist's pitch clinging where it landed, spreading where it dripped. The rebels behind the barricades scrambled — he could see their shapes through the smoke, dark against the light, moving the way people move when they realize they are standing in something they cannot outrun.

Some of them were carrying weapons. Hammers. Tongs. The crude pike-hafted things that smiths make when they decide to stop forging horseshoes and start forging a rebellion.

Some of them were not carrying anything at all.

Stoneveil noted this. Filed it. Moved on.

"Warden." Captain Harren, at his elbow. Soot on the man's face, the orange light dancing in his eyes. "The eastern approach is sealed. Sergeant Morrow's company has the tunnel exits blocked."

"The western?"

"Holding. Some of them tried to break through toward the Ashen Market. Ironborn pushed them back."

"Casualties?"

"Ours? Six wounded. One critical — took a piece of slag across the neck."

Stoneveil nodded. "And theirs?"

Harren hesitated. It was a small hesitation — a quarter-breath, the kind of pause a man makes when he is deciding how to frame a number that doesn't frame well. "Unclear, sir. The fires are — it's difficult to get a count."

"Estimate."

"Three hundred. Maybe more. Hard to tell the dead from the ones who've stopped moving."

"Those are different things, Captain."

"Yes, sir."

Stoneveil looked back at the Anvil. The fires had spread from the barricades to the buildings on either side of Forge Road — the lesser smithies, the tool shops, the cramped apartments above them where the forge workers slept in shifts because there were never enough beds and never enough hours. Black smoke poured upward in a column so thick it looked solid, blotting out the sky above the middle ring until there was nothing overhead but a rolling, orange-lit darkness.

Somewhere in that darkness, a forge bell was ringing. Not an alarm — the mechanism had warped in the heat and the clapper was swinging free, striking the rim in an arrhythmic stutter that sounded like a drunk trying to keep time. It would ring until the tower holding it collapsed. Everything did, eventually.

"Where is Blackhand?" Stoneveil asked.

"Still in the Black Anvil. The main forge." Harren pointed, though the gesture was unnecessary. The Black Anvil sat at the heart of the district like a fist of iron and stone, its chimney stacks belching smoke that was blacker and thicker than the rest — forge-smoke mixed with the chemical stink of whatever the artificers were burning inside. "He sealed the doors. Our sappers tried the tunnels but the rebels rigged the furnaces. We lost four men."

"How many rebels inside?"

"Intelligence says two hundred. Maybe two-fifty. The core. His loyalists."

Two hundred men in a forge. Stoneveil could see the building from here — squat, heavy, built in the old dwarven style with walls three feet thick and a foundation sunk deep into the bedrock. Drelgar Blackhand had chosen his ground well. The Black Anvil was not a forge. It was a fortress that happened to make swords.

He could starve them out. Seal the entrances, cut the water, and wait. Three days, maybe four. The rebellion would end the same way — with Blackhand dead or in chains and the Anvil District back under the Council's boot. It was the patient option. The measured option. The option a man chose when he had the luxury of time and the stomach for a longer kind of suffering.

Stoneveil did not have time.

Lord Commander Blackthorn's orders had been specific. *Crush it. Quickly. Before the orcs hear that our own people are killing each other and decide to test the walls while the garrison is split.* The intelligence reports from the northern scouts were already grim — Ironclaw war-parties moving south, probing, watching. The last thing Crimsonmarch needed was a siege while a third of its defenders were deployed against their own citizens in the middle ring.

So Stoneveil did the math.

Two hundred rebels in a sealed forge. Four tunnel entrances, all trapped. Walls too thick for conventional rams. A frontal assault would cost him fifty men, maybe more, fighting through chokepoints where the smiths had turned their tools into weapons and their knowledge of metalwork into killing machines. He had seen the reports — molten slag channeled through sluice-gates, steam vents rigged to scald, forge-hammers mounted on pivot arms that could crush a man's chest through plate armor.

Drelgar Blackhand was a craftsman. He had built his rebellion the way he built his blades: with precision, with purpose, and with an understanding of exactly how much heat a thing could take before it broke.

But Stoneveil understood heat too.

"Captain."

"Sir."

"Order the siege crews to redirect the incendiaries. Concentrate fire on the Black Anvil. All of it."

Harren looked at him. In the firelight, the captain's face went through something — not quite shock, not quite horror, but the expression of a man who has just heard a sound he recognizes but hoped never to hear again. He opened his mouth. Closed it. Opened it again.

"Sir, there are — our intelligence suggests there may be noncombatants inside. Forge workers who didn't take up arms. Apprentices. Some of the smiths had their families—"

"I read the intelligence report, Captain."

"Yes, sir."

"And I gave an order."

The silence between them lasted three heartbeats. Stoneveil counted them — a habit from Ashgate, where he had learned that the pauses between orders were where men decided what kind of soldiers they were going to be. Some men filled those pauses with questions. Some with prayer. Harren filled his with a single, careful breath — the kind a man takes when he is swallowing something that will sit in his stomach for the rest of his life.

"Yes, sir."

Harren turned and walked down the wall toward the siege crews. His steps were steady. His back was straight. He did not look at Stoneveil again, and Stoneveil did not watch him go.

---

The Black Anvil burned differently than the barricades.

The incendiaries hit the roof first — the chimney stacks cracking apart under the impacts, sending showers of brick and hot iron cascading down the building's flanks. Then the pitch found the ventilation channels, the narrow shafts that fed air to the forges below, and it poured down into the heart of the building like water finding a drain.

The fire went inward. The screaming started a moment later.

Stoneveil had heard screaming before. At the Battle of Ashgate Approach, he had held the pass for three days while the Ironclaw orcs threw themselves against his lines, and the wounded had screamed for hours in the rocks below the ridge where no one could reach them. At the Crimson Docks, when the raiding galleys came in low and fast and the dock workers who couldn't get clear were cut down in the shallows. At a dozen smaller engagements across a career that had lasted thirty years and cost him everything except his rank and his ability to stand upright and give orders.

He knew the sound. He had catalogued its variations the way another man might catalogue birdsong — the high, raw shriek of sudden pain; the lower, grinding moan of a wound that won't stop bleeding; the worst one, the one that sat in the back of the throat and came out in hitching, breathless gasps, which was the sound of a person who had stopped hoping for rescue and was merely expressing the fact of their dying.

The Black Anvil produced all three.

The fire inside the forge was not like the fire outside. Outside, the buildings burned the way buildings do — walls catching, roofs collapsing, the ordinary destruction of wood and plaster and cheap construction giving way to heat. But the Black Anvil was built around the forge itself, and the forge had been burning for sixty years. When the incendiaries hit, they didn't start a fire so much as feed one that had never gone out.

The crucible in the forge's heart — the great iron bowl where the dwarves smelted their finest steel — cracked under the thermal shock. Molten slag erupted through the floor grates and poured into the lower chambers where, according to the intelligence reports Stoneveil had read and committed to memory and was now deliberately not thinking about, approximately forty noncombatants had taken shelter.

He heard the sound change. The screaming from the upper levels — the fighters, the rebels, the men and women who had taken up hammers and declared themselves sovereign — was the screaming of people who understood what was happening and were trying to escape it. There were words in it. Names. Curses. The ragged syllables of people shouting at each other through the smoke.

From below, there were no words.

Stoneveil stood on the wall and watched the Black Anvil die.

The roof went first — a section near the central chimney stack folding inward with a groan of tortured metal and a eruption of sparks that rose in a column fifty feet high. Through the gap, he could see the interior — the great forge-hall with its chains and anvils, the catwalks that ran above the smelting floor, the shapes of men moving through the smoke and flame like figures in a fever dream.

One of them was still at the forge.

Stoneveil could see him — or the shape of him, a silhouette against the white-hot glow of the crucible's remains. A broad figure, shorter than the men around him, standing at the anvil with a hammer in his hand. Not fighting. Not running. Standing at his forge the way he had stood at it every day for forty years, because that was where a smith belonged and Drelgar Blackhand had never been anything but a smith, even when they called him Forge-King, even when they called him rebel, even when they called him dead.

The dwarf raised the hammer.

Stoneveil watched him bring it down.

There was no anvil-ring — the sound was eaten by the roar of the fire, by the cracking of the roof, by the screaming that had not stopped and would not stop until there was no one left to scream. But Stoneveil saw the hammer fall and the arm rise and the hammer fall again, and he understood with a clarity that sat behind his ribs like a splinter of cold iron that Drelgar Blackhand was not making a weapon and he was not making a statement.

He was finishing his work.

A section of the catwalk collapsed. The hammer rose one more time. Then the far wall buckled inward — a cascade of stone and iron that rolled through the forge-hall like a wave — and the silhouette was gone.

Stoneveil stood still. The heat from the Anvil District pressed against his face like a hand, drying the sweat on his skin before it could form. Sparks drifted past him on the updraft — tiny, orange-red flecks that winked out one by one as they rose above the wall and met the cooler air.

He did not look away. That was the rule he had set for himself at Ashgate, and he had never broken it: you watch what you order. If a man cannot stand to witness the consequences of his decisions, he has no business making them.

The screaming thinned. Not all at once — it frayed at the edges, the way a rope frays, individual strands giving way until the core was all that remained. A voice here. A voice there. The forge bell was still ringing, though the strikes came slower now, the mechanism failing in the heat.

Then the bell stopped.

Then the voices stopped.

The fire continued — it would burn for another six hours before the stone walls contained it, before the smoke thinned enough for the cleanup crews to move in with wet rags over their faces and begin the work of counting what was left. By morning, the number would reach Stoneveil's desk: 912 confirmed dead. Rebels, loyalists who got caught in the crossfire, noncombatants who had been in the wrong building when the incendiaries fell. Forty-three of the dead were under the age of sixteen. That number would be in the report too, in a smaller font, in a column that did not have a heading because no one had thought to create a heading for it.

But that was morning. That was reports and numbers and the clean, administrative aftermath of a decision that had already been made and could not be unmade.

Now there was only the fire, and the silence where the screaming had been, and the Warden of the Sundered Gate standing on the wall with his hands clasped behind his back and his face lit by the thing he had done.

---

"Warden."

Stoneveil turned.

Lieutenant Daskell. Young. Efficient. The kind of officer who wrote clean reports and never asked questions he didn't want answered. He was standing three paces back, which was the distance men had learned to keep when Stoneveil was watching something burn.

"The district is contained, sir. Captain Harren reports the eastern and western perimeters are holding. No breakouts. The tunnel exits are confirmed sealed."

"Survivors?"

"Some. Maybe two hundred made it out through the sewers before we got them blocked. We're tracking them."

"Don't. Not tonight. Post sentries at the exits and let the fires die. We'll sweep at dawn."

"Yes, sir." Daskell paused. He had something else — Stoneveil could see it in the way the lieutenant held his shoulders, the weight of an additional item on a mental list. "Lord Commander Blackthorn's aide has sent word. The Lord Commander requests your assessment of the situation for the Council session at first light."

"Tell the Lord Commander the Black Anvil Revolt is over. The district is secured. Casualties will be reported when the count is complete."

"And the Forge-King?"

"Dead."

Daskell waited. There was, Stoneveil knew, an expectation — a space in the conversation where a commander was supposed to say something about the victory. A word about the necessity of the action. The righteousness of the cause. The difficult but correct decision that had preserved order and protected the citizens of Emberfall from the chaos of insurrection. Something that the lieutenant could carry back to the Lord Commander's aide, who would carry it to the Lord Commander, who would carry it to the Council, who would nod and write it down and file it alongside the smaller number in the column without a heading.

Stoneveil looked at Daskell. The lieutenant's face was orange in the firelight, and behind him the Anvil District was a landscape of smoke and dying flame and shapes that had been buildings and were now something else. The air smelled of pitch and hot iron and something sweeter, something that Stoneveil recognized and would not name.

"Is there anything else, Lieutenant?"

"No, sir."

"Then return to your post."

Daskell saluted. Turned. Walked away. His boots made a precise, measured sound on the wall's stone surface — the sound of a soldier who had been given an order and had nothing left to do but obey it.

Stoneveil watched him go. Then he turned back to the fire.

He stood there for a long time.

The last flames were dying in the lower levels of the Black Anvil when he finally unclasped his hands from behind his back. His fingers were stiff. He flexed them once, twice — a small, private motion that no one saw and no one would ever know about. The kind of thing a man does when he realizes he has been holding himself so tightly that his body has begun to lock.

He turned from the wall.

Below, in the streets outside the burning district, his officers were organizing the perimeter — posting guards, directing the fire crews, beginning the slow work of reclaiming the Anvil from the ashes. The machine of military order doing what it did: absorbing the chaos, processing it, converting it into reports and patrol schedules and supply requisitions. By morning it would be as if the revolt had never happened — or rather, as if it had happened to someone else, in some other city, and had been resolved with the appropriate application of force.

The reports would say that. The reports always said that.

Stoneveil descended the stairs to the street level. His boots found the same measured rhythm that Daskell's had — heel, toe, heel, toe, the cadence of a man who had been walking the same walls for twenty years and knew every stone by the sound it made underfoot.

At the bottom of the stairs, a runner was waiting. Young. Fourteen, maybe fifteen. The boy's face was pale beneath a mask of soot, his eyes too wide, his hands trembling around the message scroll he was holding. He had been close enough to the fires to smell them. Close enough to hear the things that happened inside the things that burned.

Stoneveil took the scroll. Broke the seal. Read the contents.

Scout reports from the northern watchtowers. Ironclaw movement along the ridgeline. War-parties massing. The intelligence assessment used the word *unprecedented* twice and *concerning* three times.

Six months. Maybe less.

Stoneveil rolled the scroll and placed it inside his coat. He looked at the runner — the boy was staring past him, toward the Anvil, toward the glow and the smoke and the silence where nine hundred people had been alive an hour ago.

"Eyes forward, son."

The boy snapped to attention. His jaw was clenched so tight the muscles in his cheeks stood out like cords. He was trying not to cry, or trying not to be sick, or both. He was fourteen. He smelled like smoke.

Stoneveil considered him for a moment. There was a version of this — a version he had seen other commanders perform, at Ashgate and elsewhere — where the senior officer put a hand on the boy's shoulder and said something about duty, about sacrifice, about the weight of command and the price of peace. Something that would allow the boy to file what he had seen tonight in a drawer marked *necessary* and close it and never open it again.

Stoneveil did not put a hand on the boy's shoulder.

"Return to the command post. Report that I'm on my way. Tell Captain Harren I want casualty estimates on my desk by the fourth bell."

"Yes — yes, sir."

The boy ran. His footsteps faded into the sounds of the city doing what cities do after a catastrophe — the low murmur of people who have survived something terrible and are not yet sure what to do with the rest of their night.

Stoneveil stood alone at the base of the wall. Above him, the sky was a sheet of amber and black where the smoke pressed against the clouds. Below him, the Anvil District smoldered. Somewhere in the wreckage, a beam shifted and collapsed with a sound like a bone snapping, and a plume of sparks rose into the dark.

He had given the order.

It was the correct order.

He did not think about the forty-three. He would not think about them tonight, or tomorrow, or in the weeks that followed as the cleanup crews pulled bodies from the rubble and the Council praised his efficiency and Lord Commander Blackthorn signed the commendation that gave him expanded authority over the district he had just burned.

He would not think about them until six months later, when the orc horde arrived and the siege began and the war forced him back into the Anvil District — into the same ruins, the same streets, the same burned-out shell of the Black Anvil forge — and he stood in the exact spot where Drelgar Blackhand had raised his hammer for the last time, and the forty-three were finally, impossibly, all he could think about.

But that was later.

Now, Stoneveil turned from the wall, and walked toward the command post, and began composing in his mind the report he would deliver at first light.

The language came easily. It always did.
