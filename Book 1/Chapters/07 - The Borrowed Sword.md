# CHAPTER SEVEN: THE BORROWED SWORD

## Day 2 — The First Assault

---

The sword was on the ground next to a man who no longer needed it.

November found it the way he found everything in the siege — by accident, by proximity, by the dumb, mechanical logic of a man who was walking toward the sound of fighting because the alternative was standing still, and standing still meant thinking, and thinking meant the void, and the void was shaped like Horus and he could not afford to fall into it.

He had spent the night in the middle ring. Not sleeping — sitting, his back against a warehouse wall, his injured left arm cradled against his chest, watching the refugees flow past in the dark. Mothers with children who clung and didn't speak. Old men carrying bundles that contained everything they owned, which was nothing. Soldiers moving in the opposite direction, toward the wall, their boots loud on the cobblestones, their faces set in the particular expression of men who knew what they were walking toward and had decided that knowing was worse than arriving.

He had checked every face.

She was not among them.

Dawn came grey and wrong — the smoke from the outer ring had settled over the city in a permanent haze that turned the sunrise into something brown and sick, the colour of a bruise. And with the dawn came the sound: the war-horns. Deep, guttural, rolling across the outer wall like thunder from the wrong direction. The Ironclaw were coming.

November stood.

His left arm was worse than yesterday. The pain had settled into the joint — shoulder, elbow, a line of fire that ran from his collarbone to his wrist and made the whole limb feel like it belonged to someone who was in a fight he couldn't see. He'd tried to move it during the night, tested the range, and discovered that he could raise it to chest height if he was willing to accept a type of pain that started white and finished red and left him seeing spots for ten seconds.

He was willing. But willing and useful were different things.

His right hand was intact. The blister had scabbed over beneath the bandage — Horus's bandage, the linen she'd tied with quick, overlapping passes. It was dark with dust and dried blood now, the white gone to a grey-brown that matched everything else in the city. But the hand worked. He could grip. He could hold.

He needed something to hold.

The fighting was at the outer wall. He could hear it — the crash of scaling ladders, the shouts, the deep percussive rhythm of the ram striking the Sundered Gate. He could see the smoke change: the steady, forge-stained haze darkening as new fires started along the battlements, the orange flicker of alchemist's fire catching on things that weren't supposed to burn.

The secondary gate between the middle ring and the outer ring had been sealed since yesterday. Iron against stone. He could not go back to the Iron Marches, could not get to the wall, could not reach the place where soldiers fought and died in formations that had names and purposes he didn't understand.

But the fighting was coming to him.

---

The breach happened at the eastern flank.

He didn't see it — he heard it. A sound that was different from the rhythmic assault on the gate: a tearing, grinding shriek of stone giving way, and then the noise that followed, the noise that was worse than the stone — voices. Not war-cries. Screaming. The high, wild sound of men in a space too small for the violence being done to them.

Then the secondary gate opened.

Not fully — a crack, wide enough for three men abreast, the massive iron doors groaning as soldiers pulled them back. Runners came through first, sprinting toward the middle ring's garrison posts with orders that November couldn't hear. Then the wounded — carried, dragged, limping, the human debris of a defensive line that had taken a blow it hadn't expected.

And behind the wounded, the soldiers.

They came through the gate in pieces. Not formations — fragments. Two Legionnaires supporting a third between them, his leg trailing. A knot of auxiliaries with shields but no commander, their eyes too wide, their formation something they were improvising as they moved. A sergeant — the same sergeant who had blocked November from re-entering the Hall, or one who looked like him, the same flat, mechanical face — shouting orders that were assembling something out of the wreckage.

"Composite unit! South wall staging! Anyone separated from their section, on me!"

November watched the soldiers gather. A dozen. Fifteen. Men who had lost their squads when the eastern breach opened and the fighting on the parapet spilled over into the streets behind the wall. They were battered — dented armour, blood that was theirs or someone else's, the particular, hollow-eyed look of men who had been in their first real fight and were discovering that the gap between drill and combat was the width of a grave.

The sergeant was organizing them. Pointing positions. Counting heads. Building something functional out of the human wreckage that the breach had produced — a unit that wasn't a unit, a formation that wasn't a formation, a collection of strangers who were being welded together by the only force strong enough to make frightened men stand in a line: the voice of someone who sounded like he knew what he was doing.

November looked at them.

He looked at the gate behind them, where more soldiers were pouring through — some organized, most not. He looked at the wall above, where the green-blue flicker of veilfire marked the war-mages' positions and the rhythmic clang of metal on metal said the fighting at the parapet was ongoing.

He looked at his hands.

*We fight so that those who cannot defend themselves have a defender.*

The Creed. Not as a thought — as a fact, lodged in the same place where the compass lived, the inner chamber that had kept him sober and standing and pointed in the right direction for eighteen months. He was not a soldier. He was not trained. He was a civilian with a broken arm and a blister and no weapon and no armour and no reason to be here except the one reason that mattered: the walls were being held by men who were dying, and standing behind the wall while they died was something the compass would not allow.

He moved.

The dead man was lying near the staging area — a Legionnaire, face down, the crimson sash around his waist darkened to black with blood. An arrow had gone through his neck above the gorget, and the shaft was still there, broken off at three inches, the fletching lost somewhere between the wall and the ground he'd been carried to. Someone had brought him this far and then left him, because in the mathematics of the breach, a dead man was a solved equation and the unsolved ones were still coming.

His sword was beside him. Standard Legion issue — shorter than the practice blade November had used in the training yard, heavier, the edge dulled in places where it had met armour or stone. The grip was leather over wood, stained dark, worn to the shape of a hand that was not November's. There was blood on the crossguard. Not dried. Fresh enough to catch the light.

November knelt. His left arm screamed as the motion shifted something in the shoulder. He reached with his right hand and picked up the sword.

It was heavier than the training blade. The weight sat differently — concentrated toward the tip in a way that pulled his wrist forward and made the balance feel like the weapon was trying to leave his hand. He adjusted his grip, too tight, the same mistake Horus had diagnosed from a blister, and the sword settled into his palm with the unfamiliarity of something that was designed for killing and knew it, even if the man holding it did not.

He stood.

The sergeant saw him. Saw the sword. Saw the absence of armour, the bandaged hand, the injured arm held against his ribs, the face of a man who was not a soldier by any measure the military recognised.

"You enlisted?"

"No."

The sergeant's eyes moved across him — the same assessment the other sergeant had performed yesterday, the clinical evaluation of a man's military value reduced to a glance. Broad shoulders. One working arm. No training. No gear. A civilian holding a dead man's sword in a siege that was running out of living men to hold the ones that mattered.

"Can you swing that?"

November looked at the sword. He thought about the training post. The blister. The gap on his left side that a child with a stick could exploit. The reaper's arc he executed in two mechanical steps instead of one fluid motion. The three months of swinging a warped practice blade at a piece of wood and never once hitting it the way the soldiers hit it.

"Yes."

It was the most honest lie he had ever told. He could swing it. He could swing it the way a man who had taught himself by watching through a window could swing it — badly, slowly, with a technique that would make any trained swordsman wince. But he could swing it. He could hold it and point the edge at the thing trying to kill him and move it through the air in the direction the instructors' forms had suggested, and if it connected, if the edge found flesh instead of air, the sword would do what swords did regardless of the skill of the man wielding it.

The sergeant looked at him for another second. Made a decision. Pointed toward the staging area.

"South wall, left flank. Stay behind the shields. Don't die in front of anyone useful."

---

The composite unit was twenty-three men.

November counted them because counting was something his mind could do while the rest of him was trying not to think about what was coming. Twenty-three men arranged in a rough line along the south wall of the staging area, facing the gate, waiting for the order that would send them toward the breach. Seven Legionnaires — the ones with the discipline, the ones whose armour fit and whose shields locked and whose faces held the flat, professional expression that said they had done this before, if not this specifically, then something close enough that the difference was a detail rather than a revelation. Nine auxiliaries — older, less certain, their weapons a mix of Legion-issue spears and whatever they'd been carrying when the breach called them. And seven others: a scattering of soldiers from broken units, each one carrying the particular damage of having been part of something that came apart.

And one civilian with a borrowed sword.

November stood at the left end of the line. Not because anyone had placed him there — because the left end was where the line ran out, where the formation thinned into nothing, where a man without armour or training or a right to be there could stand without getting in the way of the men who belonged.

The boy beside him was shaking.

Not from cold. The morning was warm enough — the forge-haze trapped heat the way it trapped light, and the fires from the bombardment added their own warmth to an air that was already thick with smoke and ash. The boy was shaking because he was afraid, and he was young enough that his body hadn't learned to hide it yet.

November looked at him. Legionnaire's armour — standard issue, sized slightly too large, the shoulder pieces shifting when he moved. The crimson sash was clean. His sword was drawn, held in a grip that was correct but too tight, the knuckles white, the blade trembling in time with the pulse visible in his throat.

He was nineteen. Maybe. The age where the face was still deciding what it would become — the jaw not fully set, the cheekbones still sharp in the way of boys who hadn't thickened into men yet. Brown eyes, too wide for the walls, the kind that hadn't learned to stop looking at the dead.

His hands were a blacksmith's hands. November noticed this the way Horus noticed injuries — not by looking but by recognising. The calluses were wrong for a swordsman. Too broad across the palms, too thick at the base of the fingers, the pattern of a boy who had grown up gripping a hammer before he ever gripped a sword.

The boy caught November looking.

"First time?" the boy asked. His voice cracked on the second word — not from puberty but from the particular strain of asking a question you already know the answer to.

"Yes."

The boy nodded. Swallowed. The trembling didn't stop.

"Me too. I mean — I've drilled. Every day since I enlisted. Sergeant Mallow runs the sword forms at the sixth bell and the shield work after midday and the—" He stopped. Breathing. Trying to slow it down. "I've never actually — the wall. Today. This morning. The breach. They put us on the parapet and the—"

"What's your name?"

The question cut through whatever the boy was building toward — the spiral of words that was filling the space where silence would have been too loud. He blinked. The shaking didn't stop, but his eyes focused, and for a moment he looked at November rather than at the thing he was afraid of.

"Edric. Edric Thane. Legionnaire." He added the rank the way someone adds a title they haven't earned yet — with care, as if saying it might make it more real. "Gate garrison. I was — I was on the eastern section when the breach—"

"November."

"November what?"

"Falls."

Edric Thane looked at him. Down at the borrowed sword. Up at the face of a man who was too old to be this green and too unarmoured to be anything but what he was.

"You're not a soldier."

"No."

Edric absorbed this. The shaking continued. His eyes went to the gate, where the sergeant was receiving orders from a runner, where the sound of the fighting beyond the wall was getting closer, louder, the noise of a breach being contested by men who were losing.

"Why are you here?"

November thought about it. Not for long. The answer was simple and complicated and true and it lived in the same place the compass lived.

"Because the wall needs holding."

It was not a good answer. It was not a soldier's answer. A soldier would have said *orders* or *duty* or *the sergeant told me to get in line.* November said it because it was what the Creed said, translated into the language of a man standing in a line he didn't belong in, holding a sword that wasn't his, waiting to walk into something he wasn't ready for.

Edric stared at him. The shaking slowed. Not stopped — slowed, the way a wave slows when it meets something it can't go through.

"I was a blacksmith's apprentice," Edric said. Quietly. Like a confession. "Before I enlisted. My father had a forge in the Anvil."

November heard the tense. *Had.*

He didn't ask. The Anvil District had burned six months ago. Everyone in Emberfall knew what had happened to the forges, the smiths, the 900 people who died when the Warden ordered the firebombing. The boy's father was one of them, or he wasn't, and either way the forge was gone and the boy was here in armour that didn't fit, shaking.

"He taught me the hammer," Edric said. "I was good with the hammer. Not the sword. But the sword—" He looked at the weapon in his hand. "The pension wasn't enough. After the — after the Anvil. The pension they sent. My mother and my sisters. It wasn't—"

A horn blew.

The sound cut through the staging area like a blade — sharp, single-note, the signal that meant something November didn't know but the soldiers did. The line straightened. The Legionnaires locked their shields. The auxiliaries set their spears. The fragments of broken units became, for a moment, something that resembled a whole.

Edric's mouth closed. His jaw set. His hands — the blacksmith's hands, the hammer-callused hands — tightened on his sword, and the trembling became something else: not fear suppressed but fear contained, pushed down into the place where it could vibrate without breaking anything.

November gripped the borrowed sword. Adjusted his stance. His left arm hung, useless, a weight he carried the way he carried everything — because dropping it was not an option the compass recognised.

The sergeant's voice carried across the staging area.

"Through the gate! Hold at the junction! You know the drill!"

Most of them did. November did not. He followed.

---

The breach was noise.

That was the first thing — the noise, which was not a sound but a physical force, a wall of human and inhuman voices and the crack of weapons and the grinding, industrial roar of a city being torn apart at its seam. November stepped through the secondary gate into the outer ring and the noise hit him the way the blast had hit him yesterday — full-body, disorienting, a pressure that entered through his ears and settled into his teeth and the space behind his eyes.

The outer ring was a different world. He had walked these streets yesterday — had run through them, searching, shouting Horus's name into the smoke. They had been damaged then. They were destroyed now. The warehouses along the south wall were rubble. The workshops — the farrier's, the chandler's, the cooper's shop where the old man who made barrels had waved at November once from his doorway — were burning or collapsed or both, the familiar architecture of the working district reduced to a landscape of broken stone and timber and the particular, chemical stink of alchemist's fire that had soaked into everything and would not stop burning.

The unit moved through it. The Legionnaires led — shields up, in a formation that had a name November didn't know, their boots crunching over debris with the steady, rhythmic stride of men who had been trained to move through hell without adjusting their pace. The auxiliaries followed. November walked at the edge, his borrowed sword at his side, trying to match the stride and failing because his stride was civilian — longer, less disciplined, the walk of a man who moved at his own pace rather than the machine's.

Edric was beside him. The boy had migrated toward November without being told to — the way a current carries debris toward a fixed point, the unconscious drift of something looking for something solid to press against. His shield was up. His sword was drawn. He was looking at everything and seeing nothing, the wide-eyed, shallow-breathed state of a man who was processing more information than his mind could handle and had started discarding it in self-defence.

"Stay close," November said.

He didn't know why he said it. He was not the one to give advice in a fight — the boy beside him had more training, more equipment, more right to be here than November had. Edric Thane was a Legionnaire. November was a man with a borrowed sword. The advice should have gone the other way.

But Edric nodded. The shaking had settled into a steady vibration that ran through his armour like a hum, and he stayed close, and they moved together through the ruins of a district that was being contested street by street.

---

The orcs came from the left.

There was no warning — not the kind of warning that November's mind could process, anyway. Later, reconstructing it, he would remember details: the shadow that moved wrong between two collapsed walls, the shift in the noise as the fighting at the breach redirected, the sudden, visceral certainty that the air on his left side had become occupied by something that was fast and heavy and aimed at him.

Later.

Now, there was only the moment.

The first orc hit the line three paces from where November stood. A Legionnaire took the impact — shield braced, feet set, the trained response of a man whose body knew what to do even when his mind was still catching up. The orc was big. Bigger than November had expected, which was a thought that was useless and arrived anyway — the broad, dense frame of a warrior who had been bred and trained and fed for exactly this purpose, wearing armour that was part iron and part bone, carrying a weapon that was not a sword but something cruder, heavier, a thing designed to break what it hit rather than cut it.

The Legionnaire held. The shield rang. The orc swung again — overhead, a blow that would have split the shield if the soldier hadn't angled it, letting the weapon skate along the surface and off the edge. The counter came — fast, clean, the Legionnaire's blade finding the gap between the orc's chest plate and his arm, sliding in and drawing blood and pulling back before the orc could trap the blade with his body.

That was how trained men fought. November watched it happen in the span of three seconds and understood, with a clarity that was neither helpful nor welcome, the exact distance between what that Legionnaire could do and what he could do.

It was the distance between a man and a boy pretending to be one.

Then the line broke.

Not all of it — the Legionnaires held. But the auxiliaries on the right buckled as more orcs came through the gap in the wall, and the formation that had been a line became a curve, and the curve became a collection of individual fights, and the individual fights became the thing that combat actually was: not the clean geometry of shield walls and formation tactics but the ugly, desperate, crawling mess of people trying to kill each other in a space too small and too loud and too full of debris to allow anything resembling order.

An orc came at November.

He saw it the way he saw everything now — in fragments, out of sequence, the details arriving in the wrong order. The weapon first — a short, heavy blade, curved, stained with something dark. Then the arm holding it — thick, muscled, the grey-green skin of the Ironclaw covered in sweat and dust and the fine spray of blood that meant the orc had already killed today. Then the face: broad, flat-featured, tusks capped with copper, the eyes small and focused and alive in a way that said the creature behind them was not mindless, not animal, but a man — a man who was doing what men did in sieges, which was find the enemy and try to make them stop breathing.

November raised his sword.

The orc's blade came down.

He blocked it. Not well — the impact hit his right arm like a sledgehammer dropped from a roof, and his grip slipped, and the borrowed sword twisted in his hand so that the flat caught the blow instead of the edge, and the force of it drove him backward, his boots skidding on rubble, his left arm flaring with pain as his body tried to compensate for the impact with muscles it no longer had the right to use.

The orc pulled back. Swung again. Faster this time — a lateral cut aimed at November's ribs, the kind of blow that training would have answered with a step and a parry and a clean counter to the exposed flank.

November did not step. He did not parry. He threw himself backward — the instinct of a man who had never been taught the correct response and whose body's suggestion was to not be where the blade was going. It worked. The cut missed. It missed by a distance that was less than his hand's width and he felt it pass — the wind of it, the displacement, the knowledge that the space between alive and dead was four inches and luck.

He hit the wall behind him. Stone. The impact jarred through his spine and knocked the breath from him and for a half-second he was the man on the floor of the Hall of the Fallen, the blast man, the rubble man, the man who couldn't find the woman he was looking for.

The orc stepped forward.

November swung.

It was not a swing that any swordsman in Bloodhollow would have recognised as technique. It was not the overhead cut or the cross-guard or the rising strike or the reaper's arc. It was the movement of a man whose back was against a wall and whose enemy was close enough to touch and whose body decided, independently of his mind, that the object in his right hand needed to move from where it was to where the orc was, as fast and as hard as possible.

The blade hit the orc's arm. Not the weapon arm — the other one, the one that was reaching forward, the one that was about to grab November's shirt and pull him into a space where the curved blade could finish what it had started. The edge bit through the gap between the bracer and the shoulder guard and found flesh, and the sword sank in to a depth that November's brain registered as wrong — too deep, too much resistance, the feeling of a blade encountering things that were not supposed to be encountered, the layers of a body that existed beneath the skin.

The orc made a sound.

It was not a scream. It was shorter than that — a bark, a grunt, the involuntary noise of a creature whose arm had just been opened from the inside of the elbow to the middle of the bicep. The orc's weapon dropped. Not dramatically — it just fell, the fingers releasing because the muscles that controlled them had been severed, and the heavy curved blade clattered on the rubble with a sound that was too small for what it meant.

November pulled the sword free.

This was the worst part. Not the cut — the cut had been instinct, a thing his body had done without consulting his mind. But pulling the blade out was a choice. A deliberate, conscious decision to withdraw the piece of metal from the body of another person, and the sensation that accompanied it — the sucking resistance, the wet grinding sound, the smell that hit him like a wall because it was blood, human-adjacent blood, hot and copper-tinged and utterly different from anything the practice post had prepared him for — the sensation was something that would live behind his eyes for the rest of his life.

The orc staggered. The arm hung. Blood ran down the bracer and dripped from the fingertips in a steady, rapid patter that marked the rubble with dark spots.

He was still standing. Wounded, disarmed on one side, but standing. His other hand was free and it was reaching for something at his belt — a knife, a hatchet, something smaller and meaner than the sword he'd dropped.

November didn't wait.

He swung again. The same artless, desperate motion — the man with the stick hitting the door, the amateur's answer to every problem: move the sharp thing toward the threat and hope it connects. The blade caught the orc across the face. Not deep — the angle was wrong, the edge turning on the cheekbone, opening a cut that ran from the jaw to the temple but failing to penetrate the bone beneath.

The orc's head snapped sideways. He stumbled. His foot caught on debris — a timber, a piece of broken masonry, one of the thousand small obstacles that covered every surface in the outer ring — and he went down. One knee. Then both.

November stood over him.

The orc looked up. Brown eyes — not the red or yellow of the stories November had heard in taverns, the stories that made orcs into monsters. Brown eyes, the same colour as Edric Thane's, and for a fraction of a second that stretched into something far longer, November looked into the face of a man who was kneeling in the rubble of a city he had come to take because his children were going to starve if he didn't, and the man looked back at him, and neither of them was a monster, and neither of them had a choice.

November brought the sword down.

The blade hit the space between the orc's neck and shoulder. This time, the angle was right. This time, the edge found the gap between the bone guard and the collarbone, and the weight of the sword did the work that November's technique could not, and the blade went in deep — deep enough that he felt it stop, deep enough that the shock of the impact ran up his arm and into his shoulder and joined the other pains he was carrying, and the orc's eyes went from alive to something else, something that was not dead yet but was the anteroom of dead, the place a body goes when it knows.

The orc sagged. Not fell — sagged, the way a wall sags when the mortar fails, a slow, vertical collapse that started at the shoulders and moved downward. The weight of his body pulled the sword from November's hand — pulled it or November let go, he couldn't tell, his fingers unclenching as the orc toppled sideways and hit the ground with a sound that was soft and heavy and final.

November stood.

His hand was empty. The sword was in the orc. The orc was on the ground. The ground was dark with blood — dark and spreading and the smell was everywhere, it was in his mouth, in his nose, in the back of his throat where the bile was rising and the taste of metal was mixing with the taste of fear and the taste was what killing tasted like and it was going to live in him for the rest of his life.

His hand was shaking. Not the fine tremor from yesterday — this was a full, visible shake, the muscles in his forearm convulsing with the aftershock of violence, the body's protest against what it had just done. He stared at his hand. The bandage — Horus's bandage — was dark with the orc's blood. The blister was nothing. The blister was a joke, a relic from a world where the worst thing his hands did was hit a piece of wood.

*I killed him.*

The thought arrived and it was flat and it was true and it contained nothing that helped. No relief. No triumph. No horror — not yet. The horror was coming, he could feel it queuing behind the shock, waiting for the gap in the adrenaline where it could pour through and drown him. But right now, in this second, there was only the fact: he had put a piece of metal into a person and the person had died, and the person had been alive three breaths ago, with brown eyes and a copper-capped tusk and a hand reaching for a knife, and now the person was on the ground and November was standing over him and the distance between those two states was the length of a sword.

"Move!"

The shout came from his right. Edric. The boy was three paces away, shield up, his sword red to the crossguard, and his face — the face that had been shaking and wide-eyed and uncertain — was a mask. Not calm. Not controlled. A mask the way a door is a mask: something between the person and the thing trying to get in, holding, barely, because the alternative was to let the thing in and the thing was too big for the room.

November bent. Pulled the sword from the body. The resistance again — the sucking, wet sound. He straightened.

Another orc. To the right. Coming through the gap where the auxiliaries had been — the auxiliaries were gone, scattered or dead, the right side of the line dissolved. The orc was bigger than the first. Heavier armour. A shield, round, rimmed with iron, the surface painted with a symbol November didn't recognise.

The orc hit Edric first.

Shield against shield — the crash of it, metal on metal, the sound of two forces meeting and neither yielding. Edric braced. His feet slid on the rubble — two inches, three — and then held. The boy's arms were shaking. His whole body was shaking. But his feet held, and his shield held, and the Legionnaire's training did what Legionnaire training was supposed to do: it kept the shield between the soldier and the thing trying to kill him.

The orc pulled back. Struck again. Edric caught it — deflected, the shield angling to send the blow wide, a move that was textbook and beautiful and would have been applauded in the training yard and was, in the chaos of the street, the difference between breathing and not.

November came at the orc from the left.

It was not a flanking manoeuvre. He didn't know what a flanking manoeuvre was. He knew that the orc was hitting his — Edric, the boy, the shaking boy who had told him about a blacksmith's forge — and that the orc's left side was facing November and the orc wasn't looking at him, and these two facts combined in his mind into a single, clear instruction: *move.*

He swung. The blade hit the orc's shield. The impact jolted through his arm and into his shoulder and his grip slipped again and the sword bounced off the iron rim and did nothing, absolutely nothing, the futile, amateur gesture of a man who didn't know where to hit a shielded opponent.

The orc turned. Fast. Faster than something that big should have been able to turn, and November was inside the shield radius now, too close, and the orc's elbow came around and hit him in the chest.

He went down.

Not gracefully. Not the controlled fall of a trained fighter who knows how to absorb a blow and roll and come up in a defensive position. He went down the way a sack goes down — full-body, no control, his back hitting the rubble and his head bouncing off something that might have been stone or might have been wood and the world going white for a second, then grey, then the colour of smoke and dust and the underside of a sky that was still wrong.

The orc stepped over him.

November saw the boot — iron-shod, massive, close enough that the studs on the sole were individually visible against the grey light. The orc was not looking at him. The orc was looking at Edric, because Edric was the armed soldier with the shield and November was the man on the ground who had bounced a sword off a shield and was, by any reasonable assessment, no longer a participant.

The boot planted beside November's head. The orc raised his weapon.

November grabbed the ankle.

His right hand closed around the orc's boot — leather over iron, the calf thick and hard and covered in grime — and he pulled. Not hard enough to bring the orc down. Hard enough to shift his weight, to alter the angle of the blow, to introduce a variable into the mechanics of the strike that the orc hadn't accounted for because the man on the ground was supposed to be done.

The orc's strike went wide. The blade missed Edric by the margin of a pulled ankle and a shifted foot, and Edric — gods bless the boy, the shaking, terrified, willing boy — saw the opening.

The Legionnaire's blade went into the gap between the orc's hip and his cuirass. In and out. Clean. Fast. The trained stroke of a boy who had drilled the thrust a thousand times and whose body remembered even when his mind was screaming.

The orc went down.

He fell sideways, away from November, and hit the rubble with a crash of iron and bone and the particular, awful exhalation that was not a scream and not a groan but the sound a body makes when the mechanics of living fail and the air leaves for the last time.

Edric pulled his blade free. Stood over the orc. His chest was heaving. His shield arm was shaking so badly that the shield rattled against his greave.

He looked at November.

November looked back from the ground. He was covered in dust and debris and the blood of the first orc, and his right hand was still closed around the dead orc's boot, and his left arm was a single, continuous note of pain that he couldn't hear over the ringing in his ears, and he was alive.

He let go of the ankle.

Got his hand under him. Pushed. The world tilted — the same tilt from yesterday, the blast-scrambled balance, the inner mechanism trying to locate vertical. He got to one knee. Then both feet.

The borrowed sword was on the ground beside him. He picked it up.

"You grabbed his foot," Edric said.

"Yes."

"You — you were on the ground and you grabbed his foot."

"Yes."

Edric stared at him. The mask was cracking — not breaking, but the edges were showing, the nineteen-year-old beneath the Legionnaire's training becoming visible in the tremble of his lip and the wet brightness of his eyes.

"Who *does* that?"

November looked at the two dead orcs. At the blood on his sword. At the blood on Edric's sword. At the fighting that was still happening around them — the Legionnaires holding a line that had reformed somewhere to their right, the clash of metal and voices that said the breach was being contested, that the composite unit was doing what composite units did: they held or they died, and the holding was ugly and the dying was uglier.

"Get behind the shield," November said.

Edric blinked. Looked at his shield. Looked at November, who had no shield, no armour, one working arm and a sword that was too heavy for him.

"You should—"

"Behind the shield, Edric."

The boy moved. The shield came up. November stepped in behind him — the wrong position, the untrained position, the position that put the armoured Legionnaire between November and the enemy because November was not the soldier and Edric was, and the man with the borrowed sword knew at least this much about war: you stood behind the people who knew what they were doing, and you swung at the things that got past them.

They fought.

---

The fighting lasted an hour. Or five minutes. Or the rest of November's life.

Time had broken. It did not move in the straight line that November's experience of morning-to-evening suggested was normal. It moved in surges — long, stretched moments where every detail was rendered in a clarity so painful that his mind felt like it was burning, followed by gaps of nothing, black spaces where his body operated without his permission and he came back to himself standing somewhere he didn't remember moving to, breathing, alive, the sword still in his hand.

He fought three more times. Each time was worse.

The second was a scramble in a ruined doorway — November and two Legionnaires and an orc who had gotten behind the line. The Legionnaires did the work. November swung at the orc's legs when he turned and connected once, a glancing blow to the thigh that opened a cut through the leather and drew a snarl. The orc went down under the Legionnaires' coordinated assault and November stood panting in the doorway watching two trained men do in four seconds what had taken him thirty.

The third was the one that hit him.

An orc with a two-handed axe, coming through a hole in the wall that hadn't been a hole until a siege round made it one. The axe head caught November on the left side — the same left side, the gap, the dropped guard that a child with a stick could exploit. The flat of the axe hit his ribs above the hip and the pain was a new colour, a colour that didn't have a name, a shade of red that started at his skin and went all the way down to the bone and back.

He went down again. Face first this time, the rubble meeting his cheek with the intimate violence of a surface that didn't care what it was hitting. The taste of dust and blood. The sound of Edric shouting — his name, his actual name, *November,* the word strange in the boy's mouth because they'd known each other for less than an hour and the boy was screaming it the way you scream the name of someone you can't afford to lose.

Edric's shield. Over him. The crash of the axe against it — once, twice, the sound of iron on iron, the boy taking the blows that were meant for the man on the ground because the man on the ground had grabbed an ankle and the boy had decided that this was a thing worth protecting.

November got up.

This was the part he could do. Not the swordwork. Not the technique. Not the clean, efficient violence of trained soldiers who moved through combat the way Horus moved through the Hall — with purpose and precision and the quiet certainty that their hands knew what to do. He could not do those things. He was not built for those things. He was built for this: the getting up. The standing. The stupid, stubborn, animal refusal to accept that the ground was where he belonged.

He got up. He found the sword. He stood beside Edric and the two of them backed toward the line — Edric with the shield, November with the sword, the orc following until a Legionnaire's spear from the reformed line caught the orc in the throat and he went down in a spray of dark blood and the particular, gargling sound that meant the killing wound had found the airway.

The fourth time, he didn't remember. A gap in the sequence. He came back to himself standing at the edge of the line with blood on his face that wasn't his and blood on his sword that was someone's and the borrowed weapon trembling in a grip that was too tight because his hand had locked around it and could not be convinced to let go.

---

The horn blew again.

Different note this time — lower, sustained, carrying across the street and the rubble and the noise of combat with a clarity that cut through everything. The Legionnaires responded before November understood what the sound meant: the line tightened, the shields locked, and the fighting changed — not an advance but a hold, a contraction, the formation pulling inward like a fist closing.

The orcs fell back. Not in retreat — they withdrew in order, their shields facing the defenders, their weapons ready, pulling toward the breach with the discipline of warriors who had been told to stop and who stopped because the voice that told them was one they obeyed.

The line held.

The noise subsided. Not to silence — the background roar of the siege continued, the bombardment from the ridge, the distant clash of fighting along other sections of the wall, the constant, low thrum of a city at war. But the immediate noise — the noise that had been November's world for the last hour or five minutes or the rest of his life — that noise stopped, and what replaced it was the ringing aftermath that lived in the space between explosions.

November stood at the end of the line.

He was standing. He confirmed this the way he confirmed everything now — by checking, by running the internal audit that the compass demanded, the simple question and the honest answer.

*Standing?*

Yes. Barely. His legs were shaking. His right arm — the arm that had swung the sword — was a column of pain that ran from his shoulder to his wrist. His left arm was nothing, a dead weight, the injured joint having given up pretending somewhere in the fighting. His ribs — the place where the axe had hit — were a hot, spreading ache that deepened when he breathed and he was breathing too fast and each breath was a cost.

*Sober?*

The question was a reflex. Eighteen months of asking it. Yes. He was sober. In the middle of a city being torn apart, standing over bodies, with blood on his hands and the taste of killing in his mouth, he was sober. The bottle had never seemed further away or more irrelevant.

He looked at his hands.

The right was clenched around the sword. The knuckles were white. The bandage — her bandage — was soaked through: blood, dust, the grime of combat. He could see the blister beneath, or what was left of it. The skin had torn open completely, and the raw flesh beneath was stinging with sweat and blood and the fine stone dust that covered everything.

He thought about the morning. The last good morning. The bread. The light through the window. The sound of her voice saying *fix your sweep* while the hair fell back across her face.

He thought about the orc's eyes. Brown. The look in them before the sword came down. The anteroom of dead. The body going limp. The weight of it — not the physical weight, though that was real too, the pull of the sword as the body sagged, the resistance of flesh — but the other weight. The one that had no mass but pressed against his chest like a stone.

*I killed a man.*

Not a monster. A man. A person who had a face and brown eyes and copper-capped tusks and a hand that had reached for a knife because he was in a city he'd been told to take and the man in front of him was standing between him and the taking. November had put a sword into that person and the person had died, and the killing was not clean and not heroic and not the thing the stories made it — the stories in taverns, the stories soldiers told each other in the way soldiers did, the edited versions where the blade found its mark and the enemy fell and the feeling afterward was something you could live with.

The feeling was not something he could live with.

But he was alive with it. Standing with it. The compass didn't care whether he could live with the feeling. The compass cared whether he was standing, and he was, and the orcs were pulling back, and the boy beside him was breathing, and the line had held.

Edric was sitting on the rubble. His shield was on the ground beside him, the surface dented and scraped, the crimson paint of the Legion crest scored with the marks of the blows it had taken. His sword was across his knees. His hands were shaking — not the fine tremor from before but the deep, full-body shake of an engine that has been running beyond its tolerances and is discovering what breakdown feels like from the inside.

November sat down beside him. Not because he chose to — because his legs stopped holding him and the rubble was there and sitting was what his body was going to do whether his mind agreed or not.

They sat.

The dead were around them. Orc dead. Human dead. The mathematics of the breach rendered in bodies — the specific, awful accounting of what it cost to hold a piece of wall in a siege that was going to last longer than anyone had enough of anything to sustain.

Edric was crying. Quietly. Not sobs — tears, the kind that ran down a face without the owner's permission, the silent overflow of a system that had been pushed past its limits and was leaking. He wiped his face with the back of his sword hand and left a streak of blood across his cheek and didn't seem to notice.

November didn't say anything. There was nothing to say. The boy had killed. November had killed. The killing was necessary and the killing was real and no words in any language November knew could make the distance between those two facts feel smaller.

He sat with Edric the way he had sat with the widow in the Hall. Not talking. Not fixing. Just being present in the space where someone else's pain lived, because the Creed said *we do not abandon* and abandonment was not only leaving — it was looking away.

The sun climbed behind the smoke. The siege continued. The dead stayed where they were.

After a while, Edric spoke. His voice was raw. Scraped.

"Are you going to be on the wall tomorrow?"

November looked at the breach. At the line that had reformed. At the soldiers — the Legionnaires, the auxiliaries, the fragments, the composite unit that had held because holding was all there was — standing in the rubble, waiting for the order that would tell them whether to stay or to pull back.

He thought about the compass.

He thought about Horus.

He thought about the orc with the brown eyes and the knife he'd been reaching for and the weight of the sword going into his body and the weight of the body going to the ground and the weight that was neither of those things and was heavier than both.

"Yes."

Edric nodded. Wiped his face again. Picked up his shield.

"Then I'll be beside you."

He said it the way he'd said his rank — *Legionnaire* — with the careful, deliberate weight of a boy trying to make something true by saying it out loud. Not a promise. Something smaller and more honest than a promise. A decision, made in the rubble, by a nineteen-year-old with a blacksmith's hands and blood on his sword and tears drying on his cheeks.

November looked at him. At the too-wide eyes that were learning to narrow. At the jaw that was learning to set. At the boy who was afraid and willing and who had put his shield over the man on the ground because the man had grabbed a foot.

"Alright," November said.

He looked at the borrowed sword in his hand. The dead man's sword. It was heavier than the training blade. The balance was wrong in a different way. The grip was stained with blood — his, the orc's, the dead Legionnaire's, a mixture that had turned the leather dark and slick.

He tightened his grip. Too tight. The same mistake. The one Horus had diagnosed from a blister.

He did not adjust.

The wall needed holding. The boy needed a shoulder. The compass pointed forward.

November Falls stood up, and he did not let go.
