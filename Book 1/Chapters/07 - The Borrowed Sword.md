# CHAPTER SEVEN: THE BORROWED SWORD

## Day 2 — The First Assault

---

The sword was on the ground next to a man who no longer needed it.

November found it the way he found everything in the siege — by accident, by proximity, by the dumb logic of a man walking toward fighting because standing still meant thinking and thinking meant the void and the void was shaped like Horus.

He had spent the night against a warehouse wall in the middle ring. Not sleeping. Watching refugees flow past in the dark — mothers with silent children, old men carrying bundles that contained everything they owned, soldiers moving the opposite direction with the faces of men who knew what they were walking toward.

He had checked every face.

She was not among them.

Dawn came grey and wrong — the smoke from the outer ring had turned the sunrise brown. With it came the war-horns. Deep, guttural, rolling across the wall like thunder from the wrong direction.

November stood.

His left arm was worse. The pain had settled into the joint — shoulder to wrist, a line of fire that made the limb feel borrowed. He could raise it to chest height if he accepted a type of pain that started white and finished red. He was willing. But willing and useful were different things.

His right hand worked. The blister had scabbed beneath Horus's bandage, the linen dark with dust and dried blood now. He could grip. He could hold.

He needed something to hold.

---

The breach happened at the eastern flank.

He didn't see it — he heard it. A tearing shriek of stone giving way, then the noise that was worse: voices. Not war-cries. Screaming.

Then the secondary gate opened.

A crack, wide enough for three men abreast. Runners came through first, sprinting with orders. Then the wounded — carried, dragged, limping. And behind the wounded, the soldiers.

They came through in pieces. Not formations — fragments. Two Legionnaires supporting a third between them. A knot of auxiliaries with shields but no commander. A sergeant shouting orders that were assembling something from the wreckage.

"Composite unit! South wall staging! Anyone separated from their section, on me!"

A dozen men gathered. Fifteen. Men who had lost their squads when the breach spilled fighting into the streets. Battered. Dented armour. Blood that was theirs or someone else's. The hollow-eyed look of men discovering the gap between drill and combat.

November looked at them.

He looked at his hands.

*We fight so that those who cannot defend themselves have a defender.*

He was not a soldier. He was a civilian with a broken arm and no weapon and no armour and no reason to be here except the one reason that mattered: the walls were being held by men who were dying, and standing behind the wall while they died was something the compass would not allow.

He moved.

The dead man was near the staging area — a Legionnaire, face down, an arrow through his neck above the gorget. Someone had carried him this far and left him, because in the mathematics of the breach, a dead man was a solved equation.

His sword was beside him. Standard Legion issue — shorter than the practice blade, heavier, the edge dulled where it had met armour. The grip was stained dark, worn to the shape of a hand that was not November's. Blood on the crossguard. Fresh enough to catch the light.

He knelt. Reached with his right hand and picked up the sword.

Heavier than the training blade. The weight pulled his wrist forward, the balance of a weapon designed for killing that knew it, even if the man holding it did not.

The sergeant saw him. Saw the sword. Saw the absence of armour, the bandaged hand, the injured arm, the face of a man who was not a soldier.

"You enlisted?"

"No."

The sergeant's eyes moved across him. Broad shoulders. One working arm. No training. A civilian holding a dead man's sword in a siege running out of living men.

"Can you swing that?"

November thought about the training post. The blister. The gap on his left side a child with a stick could exploit.

"Yes."

The most honest lie he had ever told.

The sergeant pointed toward the staging area.

"South wall, left flank. Stay behind the shields. Don't die in front of anyone useful."

---

The composite unit was twenty-three men.

November counted them because counting was something his mind could do while the rest of him was trying not to think about what was coming. Seven Legionnaires with discipline and armour that fit. Nine auxiliaries with spears and uncertainty. Seven fragments from broken units.

And one civilian with a borrowed sword.

He stood at the left end of the line. Where the formation thinned into nothing. Where a man without armour or training could stand without getting in the way.

The boy beside him was shaking.

Legionnaire's armour, sized too large. Clean crimson sash. His sword was drawn in a grip that was correct but too tight, the knuckles white, the blade trembling with his pulse.

Nineteen. Maybe. The age where the face was still deciding what it would become.

His hands were a blacksmith's hands. November noticed this the way Horus noticed injuries — by recognising. The calluses were wrong for a swordsman. Too broad across the palms, the pattern of a boy who'd grown up gripping a hammer.

The boy caught him looking.

"First time?"

"Yes."

The boy nodded. The trembling didn't stop.

"Me too. I mean — I've drilled. Every day since I enlisted. Sergeant Mallow runs the sword forms at the sixth bell and the shield work after and the—" He stopped. Breathing. Trying to slow it. "I've never actually—"

"What's your name?"

The question cut through the spiral. His eyes focused.

"Edric. Edric Thane." He added the rank like someone trying to make it real. "Legionnaire. Gate garrison. I was on the eastern section when the breach—"

"November."

"November what?"

"Falls."

Edric looked at him. Down at the borrowed sword. Up at the unarmoured man who was too old to be this green.

"You're not a soldier."

"No."

"Why are you here?"

"Because the wall needs holding."

Edric stared at him. The shaking slowed.

"I was a blacksmith's apprentice," he said. Quietly. Like a confession. "My father had a forge in the Anvil."

November heard the tense. *Had.*

He didn't ask.

"The pension wasn't enough," Edric said. "After the — after. My mother and my sisters. It wasn't—"

A horn blew.

The line straightened. Shields locked. The fragments of broken units became, for a moment, something that resembled a whole.

November gripped the borrowed sword. His left arm hung useless.

"Through the gate! Hold at the junction!"

Most of them knew the drill. November did not. He followed.

---

The breach was noise.

Not sound — a physical force. November stepped through the secondary gate and it hit him the way the blast had yesterday. Full-body. The outer ring was a different world. Streets he'd walked yesterday, searching, shouting Horus's name — destroyed now. Warehouses collapsed. Workshops burning. The familiar architecture reduced to rubble and the chemical stink of alchemist's fire.

The unit moved through it. Legionnaires led — shields up, boots crunching debris at a steady stride. November walked at the edge, trying to match the pace and failing because his stride was civilian.

Edric was beside him. He had drifted toward November without being told — the unconscious pull of something looking for something solid. Shield up. Sword drawn. Looking at everything and seeing nothing.

"Stay close," November said.

He didn't know why. The boy had more training, more equipment, more right to be here. The advice should have gone the other way.

But Edric nodded. And stayed close.

---

The orcs came from the left.

No warning — not the kind November's mind could process. Later, he would remember the shadow that moved wrong between two collapsed walls. Later.

Now, there was only the moment.

The first orc hit the line three paces away. A Legionnaire took the impact — shield braced, feet set. The orc was big. The broad, dense frame of a warrior bred for this, armour that was part iron and part bone, carrying something cruder and heavier than a sword. The Legionnaire's counter came fast — blade finding the gap between chest plate and arm, drawing blood, pulling back before the orc could trap it.

That was how trained men fought. Three seconds. November understood, with unwelcome clarity, the exact distance between what that Legionnaire could do and what he could do.

Then the line broke.

Not all of it — the Legionnaires held. But the auxiliaries buckled as more orcs came through, and the formation became individual fights, and the fights became the thing combat actually was: ugly, desperate, people trying to kill each other in a space too small for anything resembling order.

An orc came at November.

The weapon first — a short, heavy blade, curved, dark. Then the arm. Then the face: broad, flat-featured, tusks capped with copper, eyes focused and alive in a way that said the creature behind them was not mindless but a man doing what men did in sieges.

November raised his sword.

The orc's blade came down.

He blocked it. Not well — the impact hit his arm like a sledgehammer, his grip slipped, the flat caught the blow instead of the edge. The force drove him backward, boots skidding on rubble.

The orc swung again. A lateral cut at his ribs.

November threw himself backward. The instinct of a man whose body's only suggestion was *not be where the blade is going.* The cut missed by less than his hand's width.

He hit the wall behind him. The impact jarred through his spine.

The orc stepped forward.

November swung.

Not technique. Not the overhead cut or the cross-guard or the reaper's arc. The movement of a man whose back was against a wall and whose body decided, independently of his mind, that the object in his right hand needed to move toward the orc as fast and hard as possible.

The blade hit the orc's arm. The off-hand, reaching forward. The edge bit through the gap between bracer and shoulder guard and found flesh, and the sword sank deeper than November's brain could process — the feeling of a blade encountering the layers of a body beneath the skin.

The orc barked. Short. Involuntary. His weapon dropped — fingers releasing because the muscles that controlled them had been severed.

November pulled the sword free.

This was the worst part. The cut had been instinct. Pulling the blade out was a choice. The sucking resistance. The wet sound. The smell — blood, hot and copper-tinged, utterly different from anything the practice post had prepared him for.

The orc staggered. The arm hung. His other hand reached for something at his belt.

November didn't wait.

He swung again. The blade caught the orc across the face — the angle wrong, the edge turning on the cheekbone, opening a cut but failing to penetrate bone. The orc stumbled, foot catching debris, and went down. One knee. Both.

November stood over him.

The orc looked up. Brown eyes. Not the red or yellow of tavern stories. Brown, the same colour as Edric Thane's. For a fraction of a second that stretched, November looked into the face of a man kneeling in rubble of a city he'd come to take because his children would starve if he didn't.

Neither of them was a monster. Neither of them had a choice.

November brought the sword down.

The blade hit the space between neck and shoulder. The edge found the gap between bone guard and collarbone, and the weight of the sword did the work that November's technique could not. The orc's eyes went from alive to the anteroom of dead.

The orc sagged. Slow, vertical. The weight pulled the sword from November's hand — or he let go, he couldn't tell — and the body hit the ground with a sound that was soft and heavy and final.

His hand was empty. The sword was in the orc. The ground was dark. The smell was in his mouth, his nose, his throat where the bile was rising, and the taste was what killing tasted like.

His hand was shaking. Full, visible. The muscles convulsing with the body's protest against what it had just done.

*I killed him.*

Flat. True. No relief. No triumph. The horror was queuing behind the shock, waiting for the gap in the adrenaline. But right now there was only the fact: he had put metal into a person and the person had died, and the distance between alive and dead was the length of a sword.

"Move!"

Edric. Three paces away, shield up, sword red to the crossguard. His face a mask — not calm, not controlled. A door between the person and the thing trying to get in, holding barely.

November bent. Pulled the sword from the body. Straightened.

Another orc. Bigger. Heavier armour. A shield, round, rimmed with iron.

The orc hit Edric first. Shield against shield — metal on metal. Edric braced. His feet slid two inches on the rubble, then held. His whole body was shaking. But his feet held, and his shield held, and training did what training was supposed to do.

The orc struck again. Edric deflected — the shield angling to send the blow wide. Textbook. The difference between breathing and not.

November came at the orc from the left.

Not a flanking manoeuvre. He didn't know what a flanking manoeuvre was. He knew the orc was hitting Edric and the orc's left side was open and those two facts combined into one instruction: *move.*

He swung. The blade hit the shield. The impact jolted through his arm and the sword bounced off the iron rim and did nothing.

The orc turned. Fast. November was inside the shield radius, too close, and the orc's elbow hit him in the chest.

He went down. Full-body, no control. His back hit rubble, his head bounced off stone, and the world went white, then grey.

The orc stepped over him. Not looking at him. Looking at Edric, because Edric was the armed soldier and November was the man on the ground — no longer a participant.

The boot planted beside his head. The orc raised his weapon.

November grabbed the ankle.

He pulled. Not hard enough to bring the orc down. Hard enough to shift his weight, to alter the angle of the strike, to introduce a variable the orc hadn't accounted for because the man on the ground was supposed to be done.

The strike went wide. Edric saw the opening.

The Legionnaire's blade went into the gap between the orc's hip and cuirass. In and out. Clean. The trained stroke of a boy who had drilled the thrust a thousand times and whose body remembered even when his mind was screaming.

The orc went down.

Edric pulled his blade free. His chest was heaving. His shield arm shaking so badly the shield rattled against his greave.

November let go of the ankle.

Got his hand under him. Pushed. The world tilted. He got to one knee. Then both feet. Picked up the sword.

"You grabbed his foot," Edric said.

"Yes."

"You were on the ground and you grabbed his foot."

"Yes."

"Who *does* that?"

"Get behind the shield," November said.

Edric looked at his shield. Looked at November — no shield, no armour, one working arm, a sword too heavy for him.

"Behind the shield, Edric."

The boy moved. November stepped in behind him. The wrong position, the untrained position — the armoured Legionnaire between November and the enemy. The man with the borrowed sword knew at least this much: you stood behind the people who knew what they were doing, and you swung at the things that got past them.

They fought.

---

The fighting lasted an hour. Or five minutes. Or the rest of November's life.

Time had broken. It moved in surges — stretched moments of burning clarity, followed by gaps of nothing where his body operated without permission and he came back to himself standing somewhere he didn't remember, breathing, the sword still in his hand.

He fought three more times.

The second was a scramble in a ruined doorway — November and two Legionnaires and an orc behind the line. The Legionnaires did the work. November swung at the orc's legs and connected once, a glancing blow that drew a snarl. The orc went down under coordinated assault and November stood panting, watching two trained men do in four seconds what had taken him thirty.

The third hit him.

An orc with a two-handed axe through a hole in the wall. The flat of the axe caught his left side — the gap, the dropped guard, the one a child with a stick could exploit. The pain was a new colour. A shade of red that went from skin to bone and back.

Face first into the rubble. The taste of dust and blood. Edric shouting his name — *November* — strange in the boy's mouth because they'd known each other less than an hour and the boy was screaming it the way you scream the name of someone you can't afford to lose.

Edric's shield. Over him. The crash of the axe against it — once, twice. The boy taking the blows meant for the man on the ground because the man had grabbed an ankle and the boy had decided that was worth protecting.

November got up.

This was the part he could do. Not the swordwork. Not the technique. He was built for this: the getting up. The standing. The stupid, stubborn, animal refusal to accept that the ground was where he belonged.

He found the sword. Stood beside Edric. They backed toward the line — Edric with the shield, November with the sword — until a Legionnaire's spear caught the orc in the throat.

The fourth time, he didn't remember. A gap. He came back to himself at the edge of the line with blood on his face that wasn't his and the sword trembling in a grip that had locked and could not be convinced to let go.

---

The horn blew again. Different note — lower, sustained.

The Legionnaires responded before November understood: the line tightened, shields locked, the formation pulling inward like a fist closing.

The orcs fell back. Not retreat — ordered withdrawal. Shields facing the defenders, weapons ready, pulling toward the breach with discipline.

The line held.

The immediate noise stopped. What replaced it was the ringing aftermath that lived in the space between explosions.

November stood at the end of the line.

*Standing?*

Yes. Barely. His legs were shaking. His right arm was pain from shoulder to wrist. His left arm was nothing, the injured joint having given up somewhere in the fighting. His ribs — where the axe had hit — deepened when he breathed, and he was breathing too fast, and each breath was a cost.

*Sober?*

Eighteen months of asking. Yes. In the middle of a city being torn apart, with blood on his hands and the taste of killing in his mouth, he was sober. The bottle had never seemed further away.

He looked at his hands. The right was clenched around the sword. The bandage — her bandage — was soaked through. The blister had torn open completely beneath it.

He thought about the morning. The bread. The light through the window. *Fix your sweep.*

He thought about the orc's brown eyes.

*I killed a man.*

Not a monster. A person with a face and copper-capped tusks and a hand reaching for a knife because he was in a city he'd been told to take. November had put a sword into that person and the person had died, and the killing was not clean and not heroic and not the thing the tavern stories made it.

The compass didn't care whether he could live with the feeling. The compass cared whether he was standing. He was. The orcs were pulling back. The boy beside him was breathing. The line had held.

Edric was sitting on the rubble. Shield on the ground, dented and scraped. Sword across his knees. Shaking — not tremor but the deep vibration of something that had run beyond its tolerances.

November sat beside him. Not by choice — his legs stopped holding him.

The dead were around them. Orc dead. Human dead. The mathematics of what it cost to hold a piece of wall.

Edric was crying. Quietly. Tears that ran without permission. He wiped his face with the back of his sword hand and left a streak of blood across his cheek.

November didn't say anything. He sat with Edric the way he'd sat with the widow in the Hall. Not talking. Not fixing. Present. Because the Creed said *we do not abandon* and abandonment was not only leaving — it was looking away.

The sun climbed behind the smoke. The dead stayed where they were.

After a while, Edric spoke. Raw. Scraped.

"Are you going to be on the wall tomorrow?"

November looked at the breach. At the line that had reformed. At the composite unit standing in the rubble, waiting.

"Yes."

Edric wiped his face. Picked up his shield.

"Then I'll be beside you."

He said it the way he'd said his rank — with the careful weight of a boy trying to make something true by saying it. Not a promise. A decision, made in rubble, by a nineteen-year-old with a blacksmith's hands and blood on his sword and tears drying on his cheeks.

"Alright," November said.

He looked at the borrowed sword. The dead man's sword. Heavier than the training blade. The grip stained dark with blood — his, the orc's, the dead Legionnaire's.

He tightened his grip. Too tight. The same mistake.

The wall needed holding. The boy needed a shoulder. The compass pointed forward.

November Falls stood up, and he did not let go.
