# CHAPTER THREE: THE SUNDERED GATE

## Day 1 — Before the Siege

---

The gate was older than anything alive.

Stoneveil stood before it the way he had a thousand times — not in awe, but in the grinding awareness of a man who knew exactly what the thing was worth and exactly what it would cost to lose. The Sundered Gate rose forty feet from the flagstones of the Veil's Throat, dark iron set between bastions that leaned inward like the shoulders of men who had been standing too long. Rune-wards crawled across its surface in faint blue-white lines — dwarven work, old dwarven work, the kind the human artificers maintained by rote without understanding the language it was written in.

The wards pulsed. They had been pulsing since dawn — a slow throb that the rune-smiths said responded to threat. The closer the danger, the brighter the glow.

The glow was very bright.

He put his hand on the iron. Cold. The surface rough beneath his palm, pitted by decades of acid rain and forge-smoke and the slow chemical assault of a city that poisoned everything it touched, including its own defenses. He pulled it back.

"Report."

Captain Isolde Veyne stood three paces behind him — close enough to be heard, far enough to give him the space his rank demanded. She was tall, wiry, her features sharp the way tempered steel was sharp: functional. Her armor was burnished to a mirror sheen, the one vanity he'd never corrected. An officer who maintained her kit to that standard maintained everything else to the same standard.

"Eight hundred and fifty combat-ready, sir."

Flat. Precise. No inflection that would have told him how she felt about the number. That was why he trusted her. Veyne delivered information the way a blade delivered a wound: clean, without apology.

"Composition."

"Six hundred Legionnaires. One hundred and twenty Ironborn. Eighty auxiliaries — militia, conscripts, volunteers from the lower ring. Fifty between the war-mages and artillery crews."

"The Ironbound Guard?"

"Garrison complement. Commander Thornwall is holding them at the Emberheart per Lord Commander Blackthorn's standing orders. Inner ring defense only."

Stoneveil looked at her. She held his gaze, and in it was the thing neither of them would say aloud: the best soldiers in Emberfall — the elite who drilled with enchanted weapons and answered to no one but the Lord Commander — sitting behind the innermost wall. Guarding the High Keep. Guarding the men who gave orders from rooms with roofs.

Fifty of them would have made a difference on the outer wall. A hundred would have changed the arithmetic entirely.

"Eight hundred and fifty," he said.

"Yes, sir."

He turned from the gate.

---

He walked the ramparts at the pace he always walked them — steady, deliberate, the rhythm of a man who knew every crack, every patch, every place the mortar had thinned and the engineers had shored it up with iron braces that would hold until they didn't. The wall was twelve feet thick at its base, narrowing to eight at the parapet. Wide enough for a shield wall. Wide enough for a fighting retreat.

It would come to that.

Veyne walked beside him and did not speak unless spoken to during the inspection. He valued that. Officers who filled silence with talk used words the way anxious men used drink. Veyne understood that silence was a tool. In silence, you heard the things the walls were telling you.

The eastern section first. He stopped where the wall met the river bluff — the join patched twice in the last decade, once after the Ashgate raids and once after a subsidence that had cracked it wide enough for a man's arm. The repair work was competent. The stone was lighter, the grain running horizontal where the original ran vertical, the mortar a shade too pale. From the ground, invisible. From the ridge above the treeline, where a Warlord with strategic eyes had been watching for three days, obvious.

He pressed his thumb into the mortar line. It held. He pressed harder. A granule broke free, rolled down the wall face, and disappeared.

"When was this last inspected?"

"Three weeks ago. Engineer Brask's assessment was satisfactory."

"Brask assessed the surface. What about the foundation?"

A brief pause — not uncertainty, but the recalibration of a woman who had an answer she didn't like. "No deep survey since the subsidence repair. The engineers cited resource constraints."

"Resource constraints."

"Yes, sir."

He filed it. Moved on.

The guard towers came next — twelve along the outer wall, squat cylinders of black stone topped with crenellated platforms. He climbed the nearest one and stood on the platform and looked north.

The ridge. Three miles out. The treeline dark against the grey morning sky. Behind those trees — invisible from here but vivid in the scout reports that had been arriving with increasing frequency and decreasing optimism for the past six months — twenty-five hundred warriors who intended to turn his walls into rubble and his garrison into a memory.

He could not see them. The smoke was enough. Thin columns rising from beyond the ridge where the cook fires burned, the forges worked, the siege engines were being assembled by goblins who built the way fire spread: fast, chaotic, without regard for what they consumed.

The smoke had been there for three days. It was thicker this morning.

"How long?" Veyne asked.

She knew the answer. She was asking because officers needed to hear their commanders say it — needed the certainty of a voice that didn't waver, so they could carry it back to the men who would need it more.

"Dawn. Maybe sooner."

He descended. Continued west.

---

The western flank was the one that kept him awake.

The wall dipped there — a gentle subsidence, two feet across a span of thirty, the kind of settling that happened when a city built its defenses over old mining tunnels and the ground decided, decades later, that it had opinions about the arrangement. The engineers had driven iron pylons into the bedrock. The reports said the wall would hold under normal load conditions.

Normal load conditions did not include goblin sappers who dug the way termites ate: relentlessly, invisibly, until the structure above them was hollow and all it took was a push.

Stoneveil stood at the point where the subsidence was deepest and looked down. The ground outside the wall was open — a hundred paces of bare earth scraped clean of cover and sown with caltrops. Good ground for archers. Bad ground for attackers.

Unless the attackers came from below.

"I want the mining tunnels sealed. Every entrance we can reach. Collapsed, bricked, and mortared."

"Sir, the tunnels extend—"

"I know how far they extend, Captain. Seal what we can reach. Station listening posts at the rest. Four-man teams, six-hour rotations. I want to know the moment anything moves down there."

Veyne was writing on her folding slate — a flat piece of shale in a leather case, the stylus moving with the same precision she applied to everything. He'd never seen her lose a note or repeat a question.

"And the cleared ground?"

"Second row of stakes. Sharpened, angled, chest-height on an orc. If they come from below and push to the surface, I want them bleeding before they reach the wall."

"Yes, sir."

---

They completed the circuit in two hours.

Twelve guard towers inspected. Forty-seven positions assessed. The full length of the Iron Marches walked from end to end and back, and now Stoneveil stood at the Sundered Gate once more, watching the rune-wards pulse their slow blue-white warning.

He did the math.

Six hundred Legionnaires — competent, trained, reliable the way institutional soldiers were reliable. They would hold a position, follow an order, die where they were told to die. They were not exceptional. Exceptional soldiers did not get posted to a city garrison in the ass end of the Crimsonmarch. These were the steady men, the dependable men. They were the spine of a defense that needed a backbone.

One hundred and twenty Ironborn — veterans marked by combat. Harder. Faster. The kind of soldiers who had stopped flinching because flinching required energy they no longer had. His best. The men he would place at the points where the wall was thinnest and the pressure was greatest.

Eighty auxiliaries pulled from the forges and the docks because the garrison's complement had been eroded by years of border deployments and the slow administrative bleeding that happened when a Lord Commander allocated his best troops to the engagements that advanced his career.

Fifty war-mages and artillerists. Valuable. Finite. The kind of resource that, once spent, could not be replaced in time to matter.

Eight hundred and fifty.

Against twenty-five hundred behind the ridge. Three to one. The doctrine said equilibrium. The doctrine was written by men who had never defended walls this old against an army this desperate with a garrison this thin.

---

The runner came at midday.

Young. Eighteen, maybe. The uncertain posture of a man who had been handed a message he hadn't been allowed to read. Good news didn't need runners.

"Warden, sir. From the Lord Commander's aide."

Stoneveil broke the seal — Blackthorn's mark, gauntlet holding a burning brand, pressed into black wax. The handwriting was the aide's — neat, administrative. The words were Blackthorn's.

*Warden Stoneveil —*

*Intelligence confirms imminent assault. Ironclaw host encamped beyond north ridge. Estimated strength: 2,000-3,000 combined orc and goblin forces. Siege engines observed.*

*The Emberheart garrison will maintain its defensive posture. Inner ring security is paramount. The Ironbound Guard will not be redeployed.*

*Hold the outer ring. Buy time. Reinforcement requests have been dispatched to the northern border garrisons.*

*The city's confidence rests on the Sundered Gate.*

*Lord Commander Aldric Blackthorn*

He read it twice. Not because the meaning was unclear — it was brutally clear — but because there was a younger version of himself, the man who had held Ashgate with four hundred and twenty survivors and believed that holding meant something, who needed to read the words a second time.

*The Ironbound Guard will not be redeployed.*

They would not be coming.

*Dispatched.* Not approved. Not mobilized. The word a bureaucrat used when he wanted credit for action without committing to a result. The northern border garrisons were three weeks' march away. Even if they left today — which they would not, because *dispatched* meant the request was sitting on someone's desk in a stack of other requests, each one representing a stretch of wall where men were dying while the paperwork made its way through channels — even if they left today, they would arrive long after the siege was decided.

He rolled the scroll. Placed it inside his coat, next to the one from six months ago — the scout reports, the Ironclaw movement along the ridgeline, the word *unprecedented* used twice. He carried them both the way he carried everything: close, contained, where no one could see the weight.

"Return to the Lord Commander's aide. Tell him the Warden of the Sundered Gate acknowledges the communication. The outer ring will be held."

"Yes, sir. Is there — should I relay anything else?"

The runner's hands were steady. His eyes were not — they kept sliding toward the ridge, toward the smoke that was thicker now than it had been this morning.

"No. Dismissed."

---

He briefed the officers at the fourteenth bell.

Not in the command post — on the ramparts, in the open air, where the wind carried the smell of forge-smoke and the bitter tang of whatever the goblins were cooking behind the ridge. He did it where the men on the wall could see their officers listening. Confidence was a resource, and a garrison that watched its commanders huddle behind closed doors was a garrison that started wondering what was being hidden.

The briefing was short. Stoneveil did not believe in long briefings. Long briefings were for commanders who wanted to hear themselves think.

"The enemy force is encamped beyond the north ridge. Estimated strength: twenty-five hundred. Mixed orc and goblin, with siege capability. Their engines are operational. Their commander is competent." He paused. Let the number settle. Watched the faces. "Our strength is eight hundred and fifty. The walls are sound. The gate holds. We have position, supply lines, and ground we know better than they do."

He did not mention the Emberheart. He did not mention the Ironbound Guard. He did not mention the word *dispatched*.

"The outer ring will be held. Section commanders will position their forces according to Captain Veyne's assignments. There will be no withdrawal unless I give it. No panic. No speculation about reinforcements, timelines, or outcomes. Hold your section. Maintain your rotation. Fight for the wall in front of you and trust that the man beside you is doing the same."

He looked at them. Twelve officers. Captains, lieutenants, a pair of sergeants promoted because the men above them were dead or deployed or drinking themselves to sleep at a border garrison.

They were not the best officers he had commanded. The best were at Ashgate, buried in the pass where the ground had turned so dark with blood that the men stopped trying to keep their footing and just fought on their knees.

But these would do. They would have to.

"Dismissed."

They dispersed steadily, in ones and twos, each one peeling off toward their section with the measured pace of people already thinking about execution. Veyne remained.

"Sir."

"Captain."

"The western tunnels. I can have them bricked by nightfall if I pull the engineering crew from the tower repairs."

"Do it. The towers can wait. The tunnels can't."

She made a mark on her slate. "And the eastern patch?"

"Ironborn. Not Legionnaires. I want men on that stretch who've held a breach before."

"That pulls them from the gate rotation."

"Yes."

A calculation behind her eyes. She was moving the pieces in her head, redistributing men she didn't have enough of to positions she had too many of.

"I can cover the gap with the auxiliary platoon. They're not Ironborn, but they can stand a watch."

"They can stand a watch until the orcs hit. After that, they break."

"Then we rotate them before the assault."

"If we know when the assault is coming."

"Dawn," she said. "You said dawn."

"Dawn. Probably. The goblins don't need daylight for their engines."

"Rotations in place by the twentieth bell. Four-hour watches. Ironborn on the vulnerable sections. Legionnaires filling the gaps. Auxiliaries in reserve behind the wall, ready to reinforce wherever the pressure comes."

"And the artillery?"

"War-mage detachments on the two primary bastions. Ballista crews on towers three, seven, and eleven — clearest sight lines to the approaches. Remaining crews split between the gate platforms."

He nodded. It was sound. The best deployment he could make with the men he had, and both of them knew it was not enough, and neither said so.

"The Veilfire Spire. Coordination with the war-mages?"

"Archmage Raventhorne has committed fifteen combat-ready mages to the wall, rotating in pairs. She's holding the rest for ward maintenance and..." Veyne chose her words. "Spire operations."

"Spire operations."

"Her word, sir. Not mine."

Whatever Selene Raventhorne was doing in that black tower — whatever the green-blue flames that wreathed the obsidian were powering — was not Stoneveil's concern today. Today his concern was the wall and the men on it and the smoke beyond the ridge.

"Fifteen on the wall. Enough for the initial engagement. If the siege extends, I'll need more."

"I'll relay the request."

"Make it clear that it's not a request."

Something moved across Veyne's face — not a smile, but an acknowledgment. The shared understanding of two officers who knew that the politics of command were a second front, fought with ink and protocol instead of iron, and that losing on that front was just as fatal.

She saluted and walked toward the nearest guard tower, her stride the same measured thing it always was — the walk of a woman who did not hurry because hurrying suggested uncertainty, and uncertainty was something Isolde Veyne did not permit.

She was good. She would need to be.

---

He ate standing up.

Bread and salt meat from the garrison stores, consumed at the parapet overlooking the Veil's Throat — the killing ground that funneled any attacking force into a corridor fifty feet wide and two hundred feet long, flanked by murder holes and arrow slits and the channels where boiling oil could be poured on the men below. Dwarven design. The best piece of defensive architecture in Emberfall.

It would not be enough.

He chewed the salt meat and looked at his walls. The Iron Marches stretching east and west, the guard towers at precise intervals, the ramparts where his eight hundred and fifty would stand tomorrow and the day after and however many days after that the walls held and the men on them remained alive.

The rune-wards pulsed. Brighter now. The blue-white light caught the edges of the stones and turned them into something almost beautiful.

Somewhere behind the ridge, the goblins' hammers rang.

He did not think about the Anvil. He did not think about the forty-three.

He thought about the wall. The gate. The men. The narrow margin where preparation met reality and the outcome was decided not by courage or righteousness or the favor of gods who had stopped answering, but by mathematics, and logistics, and the willingness to spend lives at a rate that kept the ledger balanced long enough for the other side to run out first.

That was what Stoneveil had. Not hope. Not faith. He had the wall, and the gate, and eight hundred and fifty men and women who would die at his command.

He had the math.

The sun went down behind the smoke, and the rune-wards pulsed brighter, and the night came in smelling of iron and pitch, and Warden Alric Stoneveil stood on his wall and waited for the war.
