# CHAPTER THREE: THE SUNDERED GATE

## Day 1 — Before the Siege

---

The gate was older than anything alive.

Stoneveil stood before it and felt what he always felt — not awe, not pride, but the particular, grinding awareness of a man who understood exactly what the thing in front of him was worth and exactly what it would cost to lose it. The Sundered Gate rose forty feet from the flagstones of the Veil's Throat, a slab of dark iron set between two bastions that leaned inward like the shoulders of men who had been standing too long. Rune-wards crawled across its surface in lines of faint, blue-white luminescence — dwarven work, old dwarven work, the kind that predated the wars and the treaties and the slow, mutual decay that had turned Grimhaldir's masterwork into something the human artificers maintained by rote without understanding the language it was written in.

The wards pulsed. They had been pulsing since dawn — a slow, rhythmic throb that matched the cadence of Stoneveil's heartbeat if he let himself notice, which he did not. The rune-smiths said the wards responded to threat. The closer the danger, the brighter the glow. By that measure, the danger was very close indeed.

He put his hand on the iron. Cold. The metal held the night's chill the way a dead man held his last breath — stubbornly, without purpose, because no one had told it to let go. The surface was rough beneath his palm, pitted by decades of acid rain and forge-smoke and the slow chemical assault of a city that poisoned everything it touched, including its own defenses.

He pulled his hand back.

"Report."

Captain Isolde Veyne stood three paces behind him, exactly where she always stood — close enough to be heard without raising her voice, far enough to give him the space his rank demanded. She was tall, wiry, her features sharp in the way that tempered steel was sharp: not decorative, functional. Her armor was burnished to a mirror sheen — the one vanity he'd never corrected, because a captain who maintained her kit to that standard maintained everything else to the same standard, and in Stoneveil's experience, the officers who let their armor dull were the ones who let their formations slip.

"Eight hundred and fifty combat-ready, sir."

She said it the way she said everything — flat, precise, without the inflection that would have told him how she felt about the number. That was why he trusted her. Veyne delivered information the way a blade delivered a wound: clean, without apology, letting the recipient decide how much it hurt.

"Composition."

"Six hundred Legionnaires. One hundred and twenty Ironborn. Eighty auxiliaries — militia, conscripts, volunteers from the lower ring. Fifty between the war-mages and artillery crews at the Veilfire Spire and the wall batteries."

"The Ironbound Guard?"

"Garrison complement. Commander Thornwall is holding them at the Emberheart per Lord Commander Blackthorn's standing orders. Inner ring defense only."

Stoneveil looked at her. She met his gaze and held it, and in that held gaze was the thing neither of them would say aloud: the Ironbound Guard — the best soldiers in Emberfall, the elite who trained on the Gauntlet Grounds and drilled with enchanted weapons and answered to no one but the Lord Commander — were sitting behind the innermost wall, guarding the High Keep and the Cathedral and the men who gave orders from rooms with roofs.

Fifty of them would have made a difference on the outer wall. A hundred would have changed the arithmetic entirely. But the Ironbound Guard did not defend the Iron Marches. They defended the Emberheart. They defended the Lord Commander. They defended the idea that some things in Emberfall were more valuable than the men who died to protect them.

Stoneveil did not say this. He had learned, at Ashgate and in every engagement since, that the distance between a commander and his anger was the distance between survival and catastrophe. He kept his anger the way he kept his sword — sheathed, maintained, ready for the moment it was useful.

"Eight hundred and fifty," he said.

"Yes, sir."

He turned from the gate.

---

The Iron Marches spread before him like the spine of an animal stripped to the bone.

He walked the ramparts at the pace he always walked them — steady, deliberate, the rhythm of a man who had been measuring these walls for years and knew every crack, every patch, every place where the stone had settled wrong and the mortar had thinned and the engineers had shored it up with iron braces that would hold until they didn't. The wall was twelve feet thick at its base, narrowing to eight at the parapet. Wide enough for four men abreast. Wide enough for a shield wall, a rotation, a fighting retreat if it came to that.

It would come to that.

Veyne walked beside him. She did not speak unless spoken to during the inspection — another thing he valued. There were officers who filled silence with talk, who used words the way anxious men used drink: to keep the quiet from settling in. Veyne understood that silence was a tool. In silence, you heard the things the walls were telling you.

The eastern section first. He stopped where the wall met the river bluff — the join that had been patched twice in the last decade, once after the Ashgate raids and once after a subsidence that had opened a crack wide enough for a man's arm. The repair work was competent. The stone was different — lighter, the grain running horizontal where the original ran vertical, the mortar a shade too pale. From the ground, you wouldn't notice. From the ridge above the treeline, where a Warlord with strategic eyes had been watching for three days, you would see it immediately.

He pressed his thumb into the mortar line. It held. He pressed harder. A granule broke free, rolled down the wall face, and disappeared.

"When was this last inspected?"

"Three weeks ago. Engineer Brask's assessment was satisfactory."

"Brask assessed the surface. What about the foundation?"

Veyne hesitated. It was a small hesitation — not uncertainty, but the brief recalibration of a woman who was realizing she had an answer she didn't like. "No deep survey has been conducted since the subsidence repair. The engineers cited resource constraints."

"Resource constraints."

"Yes, sir."

Stoneveil looked at the patch. The pale mortar. The horizontal grain. The invisible fracture line that ran from the surface down into the stone where no one had looked because no one had been told to look, because looking required men and time and both of those things were resources, and resources were constrained.

He filed it. Moved on.

The guard towers came next — one every two hundred paces along the outer wall, twelve in total, each one a squat cylinder of black stone topped with a crenellated platform where two men could stand and see the approaches. He climbed the nearest one, Veyne behind him, and stood on the platform and looked north.

The ridge. Three miles out. The treeline below it, dark against the grey morning sky, the firs and ironwoods that covered the slopes like a second wall. Behind those trees, invisible from here but visible in the scout reports that had been arriving with increasing frequency and decreasing optimism for the past six months, were twenty-five hundred warriors who intended to turn his walls into rubble and his garrison into a memory.

He could not see them. He didn't need to. The smoke was enough — thin, scattered columns rising from the far side of the ridge where the cook fires burned, the forges worked, the siege engines were being assembled by goblins who built the way fire spread: fast, chaotic, and without regard for what they consumed.

The smoke had been there for three days. It was thicker this morning.

"How long?" Veyne asked.

It was the first unnecessary thing she'd said all morning. She knew the answer. She was asking because officers needed to hear their commanders say it, needed the certainty of a voice that didn't waver, needed to carry that certainty back to the men who would need it more.

"Dawn," Stoneveil said. "Maybe sooner."

He descended the tower. Continued west.

---

The western flank was the one that kept him awake.

He didn't sleep much — four hours a night, five if the reports were clean, less if they weren't. He had trained himself out of sleep the way a smith trained iron out of impurity: by applying heat and pressure until only the essential remained. But the nights he did lie on the narrow cot in his quarters at the Sundered Gate command post, staring at the ceiling and listening to the distant clang of the forge-fires that never stopped, it was the western flank that occupied the space behind his eyes.

The wall dipped there. Not dramatically — a gentle subsidence, no more than two feet across a span of thirty, the kind of settling that happened when a city built its defenses over the mouths of old mining tunnels and the ground decided, decades later, that it had opinions about the arrangement. The engineers had reinforced the foundations with iron pylons driven into the bedrock, and the wall held, and the reports said it would continue to hold under normal load conditions.

Normal load conditions did not include a goblin siege engineer with a gift for demolition and an army of sappers who dug the way termites ate: relentlessly, invisibly, until the structure above them was hollow and all it took was a push.

Stoneveil stood at the point where the subsidence was deepest and looked down. The ground outside the wall was open here — a cleared kill zone, a hundred paces of bare earth scraped clean of cover and sown with caltrops and shallow trenches. Good ground for archers. Bad ground for attackers.

Unless the attackers came from below.

"I want the mining tunnels sealed," he said. "Every entrance we know about. Collapsed, bricked, and mortared."

"Sir, the tunnels extend—"

"I know how far they extend, Captain. Seal what we can reach. Station listening posts at the others. Four-man teams, rotating on a six-hour cycle. I want to know the moment anything moves down there."

Veyne was writing. She carried a folding slate — a flat piece of shale in a leather case, with a stylus that she used with the same precision she applied to everything else. He'd never seen her lose a note or repeat a question.

"And the cleared ground?"

"Add a second row of stakes. Sharpened, angled, chest-height on an orc. If they come from below and push through to the surface, I want them bleeding before they reach the wall."

"Yes, sir."

He looked at her slate. The list was growing. It was always growing. That was the nature of defense — an infinite catalogue of things that could go wrong, prioritized by probability and consequence, addressed in order until you ran out of time or men or both. He had never run out of both at the same time. He preferred not to think about what would happen when he did.

---

They completed the circuit in two hours.

Twelve guard towers inspected. Forty-seven positions assessed. The full length of the outer wall — the Iron Marches, the first ring, the boundary between Emberfall and everything that wanted to consume it — walked from end to end and back again, and now Stoneveil stood at the Sundered Gate once more, looking at the rune-wards that pulsed their slow, blue-white warning, and he did the math.

The math was the thing that separated him from the officers who would sleep tonight. Not the ones who were lazy or the ones who were cowards — Veyne was neither, and she would sleep because she had the grace of limited information. She knew the numbers. She did not know what the numbers meant. Not the way Stoneveil knew it, in the private, locked chamber of his mind where the calculations lived alongside the screaming from the Anvil and the small font and the column without a heading.

Eight hundred and fifty combat-ready.

Six hundred Legionnaires — competent, trained, reliable in the way that institutional soldiers were reliable: they would hold a position, follow an order, die where they were told to die. They were not exceptional. Exceptional soldiers did not get posted to a city garrison in the ass end of the Crimsonmarch while the real war ground on at the borders. These were the steady men, the dependable men, the men who did their jobs and drank their rations and wrote letters home that said *I am well* because there was nothing else worth saying.

One hundred and twenty Ironborn — veterans, marked by combat, carrying the distinction that said they had stood in a breach and lived. Better than the Legionnaires in every measurable way. Harder. Faster. The kind of soldiers who had stopped flinching because flinching was a luxury that required energy they no longer had. They were his backbone. His spine. The men he would place at the points where the wall was thinnest and the pressure was greatest.

Eighty auxiliaries. Militia. Conscripts. Men and women pulled from the forges and the docks and the market stalls because the garrison's complement had been eroded by years of deployments to the border and the slow, administrative bleeding that happened when a Lord Commander allocated his best troops to the engagements that advanced his career and left the home garrison to fill its ranks with whatever walked through the gate.

Fifty war-mages, artillerists, and support personnel. Valuable. Finite. The kind of resource that, once spent, could not be replaced in time to matter.

Eight hundred and fifty.

Against the smoke on the ridge. Against the twenty-five hundred he knew were there, the ones the scouts had counted and the ones the scouts hadn't, the reserves held back behind the treeline, the siege engines that would hit the walls with fire and stone and the particular goblin ingenuity that turned everything it touched into something that exploded.

Three to one. The classical doctrine said that a fortified position negated a two-to-one advantage. Three to one was supposed to be the equilibrium — the point where the defender's advantage in walls and position balanced the attacker's advantage in numbers. Supposed to be. The doctrine was written by men who had never defended walls this old against an army this desperate with a garrison this thin.

Stoneveil did the math.

He said nothing.

---

The runner came at midday.

A young Legionnaire — too young, eighteen maybe, with the uncertain posture of a man who had been handed a message he hadn't been allowed to read and was trying to determine from the weight of the scroll whether it was good news or bad. The answer was always bad. Good news didn't need runners. Good news could wait.

"Warden, sir. From the Lord Commander's aide."

Stoneveil took the scroll. Broke the seal — Blackthorn's mark, the gauntlet holding a burning brand, pressed into black wax that smelled of the tallow they used in the High Keep. He unrolled it. Read it.

The handwriting was not Blackthorn's. It was the aide's — neat, administrative, the careful penmanship of a man whose primary weapon was a quill and whose primary battlefield was a desk. The words were Blackthorn's, though. Stoneveil recognized the cadence: clipped, authoritative, the voice of a man who gave orders from a room with a roof and expected them to be obeyed by men standing in the rain.

*Warden Stoneveil —*

*Intelligence confirms imminent assault. Ironclaw host encamped beyond north ridge. Estimated strength: 2,000-3,000 combined orc and goblin forces. Siege engines observed.*

*The Emberheart garrison will maintain its defensive posture. Inner ring security is paramount. The Ironbound Guard will not be redeployed.*

*Hold the outer ring. Buy time. Reinforcement requests have been dispatched to the northern border garrisons.*

*The city's confidence rests on the Sundered Gate.*

*Lord Commander Aldric Blackthorn*

Stoneveil read it twice. Not because the meaning was unclear — it was brutally, perfectly clear — but because there was a version of himself, a younger version, the man who had held Ashgate with four hundred and twenty survivors and believed that holding meant something, who needed to read the words a second time to accept that they said what they said.

*The Ironbound Guard will not be redeployed.*

His best troops. The fifty — no, more than fifty, the full garrison complement — who trained daily on the Gauntlet Grounds, who carried enchanted weapons from the Vault of Ash, who answered to Commander Thornwall and through Thornwall to Blackthorn and through Blackthorn to a chain of command that ended in a room with thick walls and a door that locked from the inside.

They would not be coming.

*Reinforcement requests have been dispatched.*

Dispatched. Not approved. Not mobilized. *Dispatched* — the word a bureaucrat used when he wanted credit for action without committing to a result. The northern border garrisons were three weeks' march away. Even if they left today — which they would not, because *dispatched* meant the request was sitting on someone's desk in a stack of other requests, each one more urgent than the last, each one representing a stretch of wall or a length of border where men were dying while the paperwork made its way through channels — even if they left today, they would arrive long after the siege was decided.

Stoneveil rolled the scroll. Placed it inside his coat, next to the one from six months ago — the one with the scout reports, the Ironclaw movement along the ridgeline, the word *unprecedented* used twice. He carried them both the way he carried everything: close, contained, where no one could see the weight.

"Warden?" The runner was still standing there. Waiting. His face had the particular tightness of a man who had watched a senior officer read bad news and was trying to determine whether the silence that followed was the kind that preceded orders or the kind that preceded violence.

"Return to the Lord Commander's aide. Tell him the Warden of the Sundered Gate acknowledges the communication. Tell him the outer ring will be held."

"Yes, sir. Is there — should I relay anything else?"

Stoneveil looked at the boy. The runner's hands were steady. Good. His eyes were not — they kept sliding toward the northern wall, toward the ridge, toward the smoke that was thicker now than it had been this morning.

"No. Dismissed."

The runner saluted. Turned. Left.

Stoneveil stood in the shadow of the Sundered Gate and listened to the rune-wards pulse. The blue-white glow had intensified since dawn — brighter now, the patterns shifting in ways that the rune-smiths would have called *agitated* if they'd been brave enough to use emotional language about dwarven stonework. The wards were telling him something. The same thing the smoke was telling him. The same thing the scout reports and the troop counts and the silence from the Emberheart were all telling him.

He was alone.

---

He briefed the officers at the fourteenth bell.

Not in the command post — he did it on the ramparts, in the open air, where the wind carried the smell of forge-smoke and the distant, bitter tang of alchemist's fire from whatever the goblins were cooking behind the ridge. He did it where the men on the wall could see their officers listening, because confidence was a resource and resources were constrained, and a garrison that watched its commanders huddle behind closed doors was a garrison that started wondering what was being hidden from them.

The briefing was short. Stoneveil did not believe in long briefings. Long briefings were for commanders who wanted to hear themselves think. Short briefings were for commanders who had already thought and needed the men to act.

"Captain Veyne will distribute the defensive assignments by the sixteenth bell. Each section commander will receive placement orders, rotation schedules, and supply allocations. Questions will be directed to Captain Veyne. She speaks for me."

Veyne stood at his right. Her slate was closed. She had memorized everything on it before the briefing began — another thing he valued. An officer who read from notes was an officer who was learning the plan in real time. An officer who spoke from memory was an officer who had already fought the battle in her head.

"The enemy force is encamped beyond the north ridge. Estimated strength: twenty-five hundred. Mixed orc and goblin, with siege capability. Their engines are operational. Their commander is competent." He paused. Let the number settle. Watched the faces — the officers who had done the math, the ones who were doing it now, the ones who wouldn't do it until later and would wish they hadn't. "Our strength is eight hundred and fifty. The walls are sound. The gate holds. We have the advantage of position, supply lines, and ground we know better than they do."

He did not mention the Emberheart. He did not mention the Ironbound Guard. He did not mention the word *dispatched*.

"The outer ring will be held. Section commanders will position their forces according to Captain Veyne's assignments and await further orders. There will be no withdrawal unless I give it. There will be no panic. There will be no speculation about reinforcements, timelines, or outcomes. You will hold your section. You will maintain your rotation. You will fight for the wall in front of you and trust that the man beside you is doing the same."

He looked at them. Twelve officers. Captains, lieutenants, a pair of sergeants who had been promoted because the men above them were dead or deployed or drinking themselves to sleep in a border garrison where the definition of *combat-ready* had been revised downward so many times it had lost all meaning.

They were not the best officers he had commanded. The best officers were at Ashgate, buried in the pass where the Ironclaw had thrown themselves against his lines for three days and the ground had turned so dark with blood that the men stopped trying to keep their footing and just fought on their knees.

But these would do. They would have to.

"Dismissed."

They dispersed. Not quickly — officers who scattered too fast were officers who wanted to be away from the man giving orders, and that was a problem — but steadily, in ones and twos, each one peeling off toward their section of the wall with the measured pace of people who had received instructions and were already thinking about how to execute them. Good. That was good.

Veyne remained.

"Sir."

"Captain."

"The western tunnels. I can have the entrance points bricked by nightfall if I pull the engineering crew from the tower repairs."

"Do it. The towers can wait. The tunnels can't."

She nodded. Made a mark on her slate — the case open again, the stylus moving in the quick, efficient strokes that were the closest thing Isolde Veyne had to a nervous habit. "And the eastern patch?"

"Post a reinforced section. Ironborn, not Legionnaires. I want men on that stretch who've held a breach before."

"That pulls them from the gate rotation."

"Yes."

She paused. Not a hesitation — a calculation. She was moving the pieces in her head, reorganizing the defensive plan around the gap he'd just created, redistributing men she didn't have enough of to positions she had too many of. It was the work of a competent officer: not asking whether the order was right, but figuring out how to make it work when the numbers said it shouldn't.

"I can cover the gap with the auxiliary platoon. They're not Ironborn, but they can stand a watch."

"They can stand a watch until the orcs hit. After that, they break."

"Then we rotate them before the assault."

"If we know when the assault is coming."

"Dawn," she said. "You said dawn."

He looked at her. She was watching the gate — the rune-wards pulsing, the iron surface catching the grey afternoon light, the blue-white glow brighter now than it had been when they started the inspection that morning. Her face was unreadable. Not blank — Veyne's face was never blank, the way a blade was never blank; there was always the edge, the function, the implicit promise of what it could do — but controlled. Held in the same careful discipline that kept her armor polished and her notes precise and her voice level when she delivered numbers that would make lesser officers flinch.

"Dawn," he confirmed. "Probably. Maybe sooner. The goblins don't need daylight for their engines."

"Then I'll have the rotations in place by the twentieth bell. Four-hour watches. Ironborn on the vulnerable sections. Legionnaires filling the gaps. Auxiliaries in reserve, behind the wall, ready to reinforce wherever the pressure comes."

"And the artillery?"

"War-mage detachments on the two primary bastions. Ballista crews on towers three, seven, and eleven — those have the clearest sight lines to the approaches. The remaining crews split between the gate platforms."

He nodded. It was sound. It was the best deployment he could make with the men he had, and both of them knew it was not enough, and neither of them said so, because saying it would not change the number and would only add weight to a load they were both already carrying at the edge of what their shoulders could bear.

"One more thing, Captain."

"Sir."

"The Veilfire Spire. What's our coordination with the war-mages?"

"Archmage Raventhorne has committed her combat-ready mages to the wall defense. Fifteen war-mages, rotating in pairs. She's holding the rest for ward maintenance and..." Veyne paused. Chose her words. "Spire operations."

"Spire operations."

"Her word, sir. Not mine."

Whatever Selene Raventhorne was doing in that black tower of hers — whatever the green-blue flames that wreathed the obsidian were powering, whatever the wards that hummed through the streets of the Emberheart were protecting — it was not Stoneveil's concern. Not today. Today his concern was the wall and the men on it and the smoke beyond the ridge and the number eight hundred and fifty.

"Fifteen mages on the wall. That's enough for the initial engagement. If the siege extends, I'll need more."

"I'll relay the request."

"Make it clear that it's not a request."

Veyne's mouth thinned. Not a smile — Stoneveil had never seen Isolde Veyne smile, and he suspected that if she did, it would be the kind of expression that made the person on the receiving end wish she hadn't — but something close. An acknowledgment. The shared understanding of two officers who knew that the politics of command were a second front, fought with ink and protocol instead of iron and blood, and that losing on that front was just as fatal.

"Understood, sir."

She saluted. Turned. Walked toward the nearest guard tower, her armor catching the light, her stride the same measured, efficient thing it always was — the walk of a woman who did not hurry because hurrying suggested uncertainty, and uncertainty was something Isolde Veyne did not permit in her officers, her formations, or herself.

Stoneveil watched her go.

She was good. She was very good. She would need to be.

---

He ate standing up.

Bread and salt meat from the garrison stores, consumed at the parapet overlooking the Veil's Throat — the narrow approach to the Sundered Gate, the killing ground that funneled any attacking force into a corridor fifty feet wide and two hundred feet long, flanked by walls studded with murder holes and arrow slits and the blackened channels where boiling oil could be poured on the men below. The throat was old — as old as the gate, maybe older — and it had been designed by dwarven engineers who understood that the most efficient way to kill a large number of attackers was to make them walk single-file through a hallway full of death.

It was a good design. The best piece of defensive architecture in Emberfall, maybe in the entire Crimsonmarch.

It would not be enough.

Stoneveil chewed the salt meat. It was tough. Oversalted. The garrison cooks prepared it in bulk because it kept and because soldiers who were going to fight didn't care what the food tasted like — they cared that it was there, that it filled the hollow place in the stomach that fear and exhaustion carved out between meals, that it gave them something to do with their mouths besides pray.

He looked at the walls. His walls. The Iron Marches, stretching east and west in a curve that followed the valley floor, the guard towers rising at precise intervals, the ramparts where his eight hundred and fifty would stand tomorrow and the day after and however many days after that the walls held and the men on them remained alive.

The rune-wards pulsed. Brighter now. The blue-white light caught the edges of the stones and turned them into something almost beautiful — a lattice of ancient power, holding, watching, warning.

Somewhere behind the ridge, the goblins' hammers rang.

He thought about the number.

Eight hundred and fifty against twenty-five hundred. Three to one. The doctrine said equilibrium. The doctrine was written by men who had enough reserves to rotate their defenders, enough supplies to sustain a garrison through a prolonged engagement, enough political support to reinforce a position before it became untenable.

Stoneveil had none of these things. He had a wall, a gate, and eight hundred and fifty men and women who would hold them because he told them to, because that was what soldiers did — they held what they were given and they died where they were placed and they trusted that the man giving the orders had a plan that extended beyond *don't fall*.

He had a plan. It was a good plan. Veyne's deployments were sound. The defensive positions were well-chosen. The kill zones overlapped. The rotation schedule would keep fresh men on the wall while the tired ones rested. The artillery placements maximized coverage. The tunnels would be sealed by nightfall.

It was not enough.

He knew this the way he knew the weight of his sword — not as an abstract fact but as a physical sensation, a pressure against his chest, a tightness in his shoulders that no amount of planning or discipline or the sheer, grinding force of will that had kept him standing at Ashgate and the Crimson Docks and the Anvil could relieve. The math was the math. The walls were the walls. The men were the men. And the number on the other side of the ridge was a number that made all of his numbers meaningless.

He finished the salt meat. Folded the cloth it had been wrapped in and placed it in his coat pocket, because waste was the habit of men who believed they would have more tomorrow, and Stoneveil was not that kind of man.

He stood at the parapet and watched the sun move behind the smoke.

The light changed. Not the way light changed in other cities — the clean, golden shift from afternoon to evening that poets wrote about and lovers noticed and ordinary people took for granted because it happened every day and would happen every day until it didn't. In Emberfall, the light changed the way everything changed: through a filter of forge-smoke and soot, the sky turning from grey to a deeper grey, the horizon bleeding into a band of copper and rust that was half sunset and half industrial haze.

The smoke beyond the ridge thickened. New fires. More fires. The goblins were heating their alchemist's fire — the clay pots that would be loaded into the catapults and the trebuchet they called the Jawbreaker, the ones that would arc over his walls and burst on impact and burn whatever they touched with a heat that water could not extinguish.

He watched the smoke and thought about eight hundred and fifty.

He thought about the scroll in his coat. *The Ironbound Guard will not be redeployed.* He thought about the Lord Commander in the High Keep, behind the inner ring, behind the Ironbound Guard, behind every wall that Stoneveil's men would bleed to hold. He thought about the aide's handwriting — neat, administrative, the penmanship of a man who would survive this siege because he was positioned behind enough stone and enough soldiers that the war would reach him last, if it reached him at all.

He did not think about the Anvil.

He did not think about the forty-three.

He thought about the wall. The gate. The men. The number. The things he could control and the things he could not, and the narrow, razor-thin margin between them where a competent commander lived — the space where preparation met reality and the outcome was decided not by courage or righteousness or the favor of gods who had stopped answering, but by mathematics, and logistics, and the willingness to spend lives at a rate that kept the ledger balanced long enough for the other side to run out of them first.

That was what Stoneveil had. Not hope. Not faith. Not the comfort of knowing that what he defended was worth the price of defending it. He had the wall, and the gate, and eight hundred and fifty men and women who would die at his command.

He had the math.

The sun went down behind the smoke, and the rune-wards on the Sundered Gate pulsed brighter, and the night came in smelling of iron and pitch, and Warden Alric Stoneveil stood on his wall and waited for the war.
