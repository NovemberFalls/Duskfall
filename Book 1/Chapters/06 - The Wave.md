# CHAPTER SIX: THE WAVE

## Day 2 — The First Assault

---

Dawn came with teeth.

Stoneveil was on the rampart when the first wave broke against the wall — not the bombardment, which had continued through the night in sporadic bursts designed to deny sleep and test the wards, but the real thing. The infantry. Twelve hundred orc warriors pouring down the ridge in a tide of iron and hide that filled the killing ground of the Veil's Throat and spilled around both flanks simultaneously, hitting the eastern and western sections of the Iron Marches in a coordinated assault that was, Stoneveil noted with the clinical detachment of a man who had seen this geometry before, competent.

The enemy commander was not a fool.

He had known this from the bombardment — the targeting, the sequencing, the way the siege engines walked their fire along the wall in patterns designed to probe the wards rather than simply hammer the stone. But seeing the infantry deployment confirmed it. The gate assault was the fist. The flanks were the fingers. The Warlord on the ridge was trying to close his hand around the entire outer ring at once, and the only reason it wasn't working was that the hand wasn't quite big enough.

Not yet.

"Eastern wall — status."

Veyne was beside him. She had been beside him since before dawn, since he'd dismissed his aide and told the captain he wanted her on the rampart for the duration because the aide was competent and Veyne was necessary. She had not slept. He could see it in the set of her jaw, the faint, compressed tightness around her eyes that was the only concession her face made to exhaustion. She wore it the way she wore her armour — as a condition of service, not a complaint.

"Ironborn holding the patch section. Lieutenant Grieve reports contact along the full eastern face. Scaling ladders at three points. Two repulsed. The third—" She paused. Consulted the runner standing two paces behind her, a Legionnaire whose face was the colour of old plaster. "The third breach attempt is ongoing. Grieve has committed his reserve section."

"Already?"

"Sir. The assault on the eastern face is heavier than projected."

Heavier than projected. The phrase sat in the tactical lexicon alongside *resource constraints* and *dispatched* — the language of a system that had been designed to accommodate a certain degree of failure and was now discovering that the degree had been set too low.

Stoneveil looked east. From the rampart above the Sundered Gate, the wall curved away into the smoke — the permanent, forge-stained haze that sat over the Iron Marches was now thickened by the dust of combat, the acrid bite of alchemist's fire, and something else, something organic, the smell of a battle that had been going for twenty minutes and was already producing the particular stench that came from the intersection of iron and flesh.

He could see the fighting. Not the details — details required proximity, and proximity was a luxury that commanders traded for the wider view — but the shape of it. The eastern wall was a line of dark metal and stone interrupted at three points by the vertical strokes of scaling ladders, and at each ladder the defenders were a knot of armour and movement that from this distance looked like an infection — a local inflammation, bright and violent, against the body of the wall.

Two of the knots were subsiding. The ladders pushed back, toppled, the defenders reforming their line with the practised efficiency of men who had drilled the response and were now performing it under conditions that the drill had not adequately replicated.

The third knot was growing.

"Get me a runner."

A boy — too young, they were all too young — materialised at his elbow. Stoneveil did not look at him.

"To Lieutenant Grieve, eastern section. Reinforce the third breach point with his auxiliary platoon. Ironborn hold the line. Auxiliaries fill behind them and hold the ladders at the base. If the orcs establish a foothold on the parapet, he is to contain it and push them off. He is not to withdraw."

"Yes, sir."

The boy ran. Stoneveil watched him go for one second — the narrow shoulders, the too-loose helmet, the stride of someone who was running because he had been told to run and whose understanding of why extended no further than the order — and then turned back to the wall.

"Western flank."

"Sergeant Dorran reports probing attacks along the subsidence line. No scaling attempts yet. The tunnels are sealed — no vibrations from the listening posts."

"The goblins?"

"Skrixx's sappers have not been sighted on the western approach. The bombardment from that angle is focused on the wall face, not the foundations."

Stoneveil considered this. The western flank was the one he feared — the soft ground, the mining tunnels, the subsidence that no amount of iron pylons could fully correct. The orc commander would know about the soft ground. The goblin had seen it before Stoneveil's own engineers had. If the sappers were not on the western approach, they were either being held in reserve or they were already underground, and the listening posts had not detected them, and the sealed tunnels were holding, and the silence from below was either good news or the worst news he would receive today.

He filed it. The western flank was a problem for the next hour. The eastern breach was a problem for the next five minutes.

---

The gate assault hit at the second bell.

Stoneveil heard it before he saw it — not the sound of impact, which was constant now, the percussive rhythm of siege rounds striking stone and the lighter, sharper crack of catapult loads bursting against the wards — but the sound of the assault itself. The war cry. The deep, guttural roar of three hundred orc warriors hitting the Veil's Throat at a dead run, their voices merging into a single, sustained note that was part rage and part grief and part the sound a thousand years of survival made when it was compressed into the width of a killing ground and pointed at a door.

The Veil's Throat did what it was designed to do. The corridor funnelled the assault — fifty feet wide, two hundred feet long, flanked by walls of stone and iron that turned the approach into a channel. The murder holes opened. Boiling oil cascaded down the flank walls in sheets that hit the lead elements of the charge and produced a sound that Stoneveil catalogued and dismissed: the high, raw shriek of scalded flesh, the noise of men discovering that the walls were not simply barriers but weapons.

The archers opened from the bastions. Twenty on each side, the rate of fire disciplined — not the frantic, panicked volley of untrained bowmen but the measured, two-second interval of soldiers who had been taught to aim, release, nock, aim, release, and to treat each arrow as currency being spent rather than anger being expressed.

The first rank of the orc charge went down. The second rank ran over them. The third rank was already at the gate.

They hit it with rams — crude, massive, iron-banded timber carried by eight warriors apiece. The impact shuddered through the wall. Stoneveil felt it in his feet, transmitted through the stone, a physical fact that arrived in his knees and climbed his spine and settled behind his sternum where the other impacts lived: the Anvil, Ashgate, every blow he had absorbed and converted into the next order.

The rune-wards flared. Blue-white light erupted across the gate's surface in a lattice of ancient symbols that pushed back against the ram's impact with a force that was not physical — or was, but in a way that the vocabulary of siege engineering did not accommodate. The ram bounced. Not far — a foot, perhaps two — but enough to stagger the warriors carrying it, and in the half-second of their stagger the archers sent another volley into the ram crew and three of the eight went down.

New hands took the ram. The gate absorbed another blow.

"Gate holding?" Stoneveil asked.

"Holding, sir. The wards are intact. Rune-smith assessment is stable — no fracture lines, no degradation."

"The eastern bastion?"

A pause. Veyne turned to a different runner — a woman this time, older, steadier, carrying the particular expression of someone who had been delivering bad news all morning and had stopped apologising for it.

"Rune-ward fracture along the bastion's lower face. The blast yesterday — the siege round that hit the Hall of the Fallen — compromised the ward matrix at the join. The rune-smiths are patching it, but they need time."

Time. The one resource Stoneveil could not manufacture.

"How long?"

"Two hours for a stable patch. Six for a full restoration."

"They have one."

Veyne made a note on her slate. The stylus moved in her quick, efficient strokes — a habit he'd watched for years and still found reassuring, the way a drowning man found the edge of a boat reassuring. Not because it would save him, but because it meant someone was keeping track.

---

The morning was a ledger.

Stoneveil managed it the way he managed all engagements — not from the front, not from the back, but from the place where information converged and decisions had to be made before the information was complete. He stood on the rampart above the Sundered Gate and the battle arranged itself around him like a system of rivers feeding a single point, each one carrying a current of reports, casualty estimates, supply requests, and the particular, granular details of organised violence that added up to an answer no one wanted.

The eastern breach held. Grieve's auxiliaries arrived in time — barely — and the Ironborn pushed the orcs off the parapet in a fight that lasted eleven minutes and cost four defenders dead and nine wounded. The auxiliaries, to their credit, did not break. They stood behind the Ironborn and held the ladders at the base with shields and spears and the specific, terrified determination of men who had never been in combat and were discovering, in real time, the gap between what they had imagined and what was actually happening.

Stoneveil filed this. The auxiliaries could fight. Not well. Not long. But they could fight.

The western flank remained quiet. Probing attacks only — small groups of orc warriors testing the defenses, pulling back when the response came, measuring reaction times and deployment patterns. It was reconnaissance, not assault. The real push on the west would come later, when the defender's attention was fixed on the gate and the east, and the goblin sappers surfaced from wherever they were digging.

Stoneveil knew this because it was what he would have done.

The gate took eleven ram strikes before the orc commander pulled the assault back. The wards held. The archers held. The oil and the murder holes held. The Veil's Throat was choked with dead — orc warriors piled in the narrow corridor like driftwood after a flood, the bodies cooling in the shadow of the walls that had killed them.

Stoneveil counted them from the rampart. Forty-three.

The number hit him before he could stop it. Not the count — the echo. Forty-three orc dead in the Throat, and forty-three children dead in the Anvil, and the symmetry was not real, was not significant, was a coincidence of arithmetic that his mind should have processed and discarded the way it processed every other number that crossed his desk.

He discarded it. Filed it. The gap between filing and forgetting was a distance he had learned to maintain.

"Casualty report."

Veyne consulted her slate. The stylus was still. She was reading, not writing — the numbers already recorded, the ledger already balanced.

"Twenty-seven dead. Forty-one wounded, of which nineteen can return to the wall after treatment. Six critical — unlikely to survive the day."

Twenty-seven dead. In four hours of fighting. Stoneveil did the math — not because the math was difficult but because doing it was the discipline that kept the number from becoming something else. Something with faces.

Twenty-seven from eight hundred and fifty left eight hundred and twenty-three. Nineteen returning from the wounded brought it to eight hundred and forty-two effective. The six criticals would be dead by evening, which brought the net to eight hundred and seventeen. And tomorrow there would be another assault, and another number, and the ledger would balance again, and again, until it balanced for the last time.

"Enemy casualties?"

"Estimated one hundred and sixty. One hundred confirmed dead in the Throat and at the base of the eastern wall. The rest are wound estimates from the archers."

One hundred and sixty. Against twenty-seven. A kill ratio of nearly six to one. In the doctrine, that was a defensive victory. In the doctrine, that ratio meant the wall was doing its job and the defenders were performing above standard and the siege would fail because the attacker could not sustain losses at that rate.

The doctrine did not account for the fact that the attacker had twenty-five hundred warriors and the defender had eight hundred and seventeen. At six to one, Stoneveil could kill every orc on the ridge and still run out of men before they ran out of bodies.

The math was the math.

"Rotation. First through fourth sections, four-hour relief. Pull the eastern auxiliaries off the wall and replace them with Legionnaires from the reserve. The auxiliaries need rest before they crack."

"Sir, that leaves the reserve at—"

"I know what it leaves the reserve at, Captain."

She closed her mouth. Not from rebuke — Veyne did not respond to rebuke the way other officers did, with the flinch that said the blow had landed. She closed it because the calculation was already running behind her eyes, the same calculation Stoneveil had just performed, and she was arriving at the same number, and the number did not require discussion.

"Replacement auxiliaries to reserve. First section to the eastern wall. Ironborn maintain their positions. The gate section holds as deployed."

"And the war-mages?"

"Rotation with the sections. Keep the pairs on the bastions. When the ward patch is complete, I want the freed rune-smiths redistributed to the eastern towers — whatever enchantments they can lay on the stonework before the next assault."

Veyne wrote. The stylus moved. The ledger updated.

---

The second assault came at midday.

It was harder.

The bombardment preceded it — two hours of sustained fire from the ridge, the catapults and the Jawbreaker pounding the eastern wall with a consistency that said the orc commander had solved whatever mechanical problem had caused the gaps in the night bombardment. The rounds came every forty seconds. Each one a tremor. Each one a test.

The rune-ward patch held. Barely. The rune-smiths reported stress fractures forming in the repair matrix — the old dwarven work resisting the new, the ancient enchantments recognising the patch the way a body recognises a transplant: as something foreign, something to be tolerated rather than integrated.

Stoneveil filed this. Another hour. Another degradation. Another entry in the ledger of things that were failing at a rate he could measure but not stop.

The infantry hit the eastern wall and the gate simultaneously. The same geometry as the morning — the fist and the fingers — but tighter. The ladders went up faster. The ram crews were larger, the warriors who held them armoured more heavily, their shields overlapping to form a testudo that deflected the arrows from the bastions. Someone had learned from the morning. Someone had adjusted.

The eastern wall buckled.

Not the stone — the line. The Legionnaires who had replaced the auxiliaries were fresh, rested, competent in the reliable way that institutional soldiers were competent. But they had not been on this section before. They did not know the angles, the dead spots where the murder holes could not reach, the places where the parapet narrowed and a shield wall had to stagger or lose its cohesion. They held. They were pushed. They held again. They were pushed again.

A ladder established on the parapet. Orc warriors — Ironclaw, the heavy infantry, the ones who wore the tooth-and-bone insignia of the warbands that had fought at Stonehaven — reached the top and met the Legionnaires in the confined space of the wall's crown.

It was ugly. Combat on a wall always was. No room to swing. No room to manoeuvre. Just two lines of men pressing against each other in a space eight feet wide, shields grinding, blades finding the gaps between armour plates, the intimate, grinding violence of men killing each other at a distance closer than a handshake.

The Legionnaires were trained. The orcs were stronger.

Stoneveil watched from the gate rampart. He could see the breach expanding — the line bowing inward as more orcs crested the ladder and pushed into the wedge of parapet they had claimed. Three feet. Five. Eight. A pocket of Ironclaw warriors on his wall, their backs to the crenellations, their faces toward the defenders, their weapons doing the work that weapons did.

He did not send reinforcements. Not yet. The reserve was thin. The auxiliaries were resting. The western flank was quiet and that quiet was getting louder.

"Ballista three."

Veyne understood. "Tower three, sir? They'll be firing into—"

"Into the ladder point. The orcs on the parapet are supplied from below. Cut the supply. The men on the wall can handle what's already up."

The order went. The ballista on tower three — the squat, iron-braced engine that covered the eastern approach with a firing arc of forty degrees — adjusted its aim. The crew had been targeting the assault force at the base of the wall. Now the bolt swung toward the ladder itself, the anchor point where the orcs were climbing, the bottleneck that fed the breach.

The first bolt hit the ladder's base. Iron and wood, propelled with a force that a man's arm could not replicate — it punched through the timber and into the warriors clustered at the foot, and the ladder buckled, and the supply of orcs onto the parapet stopped.

The pocket on the wall — cut off, surrounded, outnumbered by the Legionnaires who closed around them — lasted four more minutes.

Stoneveil watched them die. The last orc on the parapet took two spears and a sword thrust and went backward over the crenellation, falling the forty feet to the base of the wall without making a sound. The Legionnaires reformed. The gap closed. The line held.

"Eastern breach contained."

"Casualties?"

"Eight dead. Fourteen wounded."

Eight more. Eight hundred and nine effective, once the wounded from the morning rotation were factored. Tomorrow it would be fewer. The day after, fewer still. The ledger did not lie.

The gate held again. The wards held. The ram crews bled and pulled back, and the Veil's Throat added another layer of dead to the ones already cooling in its shadows, and the afternoon began with the silence that followed the second withdrawal — not peace, not calm, but the held breath of an army that had been pushed back twice and was deciding how hard to push a third time.

---

Stoneveil ate standing up.

Salt meat. The same ration he'd eaten yesterday, at the same parapet, watching the same approach. The bread was harder. The water tasted of iron — the pipes that fed the rampart cisterns ran through the wall's core, and the bombardment had shaken sediment loose from the joins. He chewed. Swallowed. Did not taste.

The sun had moved behind the smoke — the permanent column that rose from the outer ring, thicker now with the fires from the bombardment added to the forge-haze. The light was amber. Wrong. The light had been wrong since the siege began and would stay wrong until the smoke cleared, and the smoke would not clear until the fires went out, and the fires would not go out until the fighting stopped, and the fighting would not stop until one side ran out of men.

"The Emberheart?" he asked.

Veyne understood the question. "No communication from Lord Commander Blackthorn since yesterday's dispatch. The Ironbound Guard remains at the Gauntlet Grounds. No change in deployment."

He did not react. Reaction was a resource, and he spent it only where it changed the outcome.

"Supplies."

"Arrows at seventy per cent. Ballista bolts at sixty. Alchemy stores" — she meant the oil, the fire pots, the caustic compounds that the engineers poured through the murder holes — "at fifty-five per cent."

"At current expenditure rate?"

"Three days. Four if we reduce the oil to half-rations."

Three days. Maybe four. After that, the murder holes would pour nothing, and the archers would throw rocks, and the walls would be held by men with swords and shields and the particular, grinding conviction that the alternative to holding was worse than the cost.

"Reduce to half-rations on the oil. Conserve the alchemy stores for the gate approaches. The eastern and western walls fight with steel and arrow."

"Sir."

He chewed the salt meat. Finished it. Folded the cloth. Placed it in his pocket.

The rune-wards pulsed. Dimmer than yesterday. The bombardment was wearing them — each impact leaching a fraction of the enchantment, the dwarven work giving up its stored power in increments too small to see and too large to ignore. The rune-smiths could patch and restore, but they could not replace what the wards were spending. The enchantment was finite. It had been laid into the stone by artisans who understood the craft at a depth the human rune-smiths could only approximate, and the approximation was good enough for maintenance but not for war.

The wards would fail. Not today. Not tomorrow. But they would fail. The gate would go from enchanted iron to ordinary iron, and ordinary iron broke.

Stoneveil looked at the approach. The Veil's Throat, carpeted with the dead. The killing ground beyond it, scarred with catapult impacts and stained with the dark, spreading patches that marked where the wounded had bled out in the open because no one could reach them. The ridge, where the smoke from the orc camp mixed with the smoke from the city in a grey-brown haze that turned the sky into something neither side would claim.

Somewhere on that ridge, the orc commander was doing the same arithmetic. Counting his dead. Measuring the gap between what the siege had cost and what it had gained. Adjusting.

The machine worked. Stoneveil's deployments held. The rotations held. The sections held their positions and fought their fights and reported their dead and went back to the wall when they were told to go back to the wall. The doctrine worked. The training worked. The walls worked.

The numbers were wrong.

They had been wrong since Blackthorn's dispatch. They had been wrong since the first scout report six months ago, when the smoke on the ridge was a thread and the Ironclaw were a possibility rather than a certainty and the garrison's complement was a number on a page rather than a line of men standing on a wall waiting to die.

The machine worked. The machine would continue to work. It would process the inputs — the dead, the wounded, the consumed supplies, the degrading wards — and produce the outputs: positions held, sections rotated, reports filed, orders given. The machine did not know or care that the inputs were exceeding the outputs at a rate that could not be sustained. The machine did what machines did. It ran until it broke.

Stoneveil stood on his wall and watched the smoke and waited for the third assault.

It did not come.

Not today. The orc commander had pulled back to the ridge. Licking wounds. Counting dead. Reconsidering. That was the rational assessment and Stoneveil accepted it because it was the assessment that allowed him to rotate his defenders and rest his wounded and begin the repairs that the day's fighting had made necessary.

But the silence had a weight to it. The same weight as the silence after the Anvil, when the screaming stopped and the fires burned low and the city settled back into the illusion of order. A silence that was not peace. A silence that was reloading.

He stood on the rampart as the sun went down behind the smoke. The rune-wards pulsed. The amber light faded to rust and the rust faded to the grey that was Emberfall's version of twilight — the death of a day that had been spent the way all days would be spent until the siege ended: in blood, and iron, and the meticulous, grinding arithmetic of a man holding a wall with numbers that would never, could never, add up.

Eight hundred and nine.

The number sat behind his ribs the way the forty-three sat — not as a fact but as a weight. A debt he was accumulating, entry by entry, name by name, against a ledger that had no column for what was owed and no mechanism for repayment.

He had not slept. He would not sleep tonight.

The wall needed him. The numbers needed him. The machine needed the man who did the math that no one else would do, who carried the answers that no one else would carry, who stood on the rampart and watched the smoke and understood, with the clarity that sat behind his ribs like a blade, that the wall would hold until it didn't, and the men would fight until they couldn't, and the arithmetic of blood would balance, eventually, the way all arithmetic balanced.

With an answer.

Stoneveil did not know what the answer would be. He knew only that it was coming, carried on the next wave, or the one after that, or the one after that — and that when it arrived, he would be standing on this wall, doing the math, giving the orders, watching what he had ordered.

Because that was the rule.

You watch what you order.

The dark came in. The wards pulsed. The silence reloaded.

And the Warden of the Sundered Gate stood on his wall and waited for tomorrow.
