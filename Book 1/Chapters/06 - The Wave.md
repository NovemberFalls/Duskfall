# CHAPTER SIX: THE WAVE

## Day 2 — The First Assault

---

Dawn came with teeth.

Stoneveil was on the rampart when the first wave broke — not the bombardment, which had continued through the night in sporadic bursts designed to deny sleep, but the real thing. Twelve hundred orc warriors pouring down the ridge in a tide of iron and hide, hitting the eastern and western sections of the Iron Marches simultaneously. A coordinated assault that was, Stoneveil noted with the detachment of a man who had seen this geometry before, competent.

The enemy commander was not a fool.

He had known this from the bombardment — the targeting, the sequencing, the way the siege engines walked their fire in patterns designed to probe the wards rather than simply hammer the stone. The gate assault was the fist. The flanks were the fingers. The Warlord on the ridge was trying to close his hand around the entire outer ring, and the only reason it wasn't working was that the hand wasn't quite big enough.

Not yet.

"Eastern wall — status."

Veyne was beside him. She had been since before dawn, since he'd dismissed his aide and told her he wanted her on the rampart for the duration because the aide was competent and Veyne was necessary. She had not slept. He could see it in the compressed tightness around her eyes — the only concession her face made to exhaustion.

"Ironborn holding the patch section. Lieutenant Grieve reports contact along the full eastern face. Scaling ladders at three points. Two repulsed." She consulted the runner behind her — a Legionnaire whose face was the colour of old plaster. "Third breach attempt ongoing. Grieve has committed his reserve section."

"Already?"

"The assault on the eastern face is heavier than projected."

Stoneveil looked east. The wall curved away into the smoke — forge-haze thickened by combat dust, the acrid bite of alchemist's fire, and the particular stench that came from the intersection of iron and flesh. He could see the shape of the fighting. Three points where scaling ladders interrupted the line, and at each one a knot of armour and violence. Two of the knots were subsiding — ladders toppled, defenders reforming with the practised efficiency of men performing a drill under conditions the drill had not replicated.

The third knot was growing.

"Get me a runner."

A boy — too young, they were all too young — materialised at his elbow.

"To Lieutenant Grieve, eastern section. Reinforce the third breach point with his auxiliary platoon. Ironborn hold the line. Auxiliaries fill behind and hold the ladders at the base. If the orcs establish a foothold on the parapet, contain and push. He is not to withdraw."

"Yes, sir."

The boy ran. Stoneveil watched him for one second — narrow shoulders, too-loose helmet, the stride of someone running because he'd been told to run — and turned back.

"Western flank."

"Sergeant Dorran reports probing attacks along the subsidence line. No scaling attempts. Tunnels sealed — no vibrations from the listening posts."

"The goblins?"

"Skrixx's sappers have not been sighted on the western approach."

Stoneveil considered this. The western flank was the one he feared — the soft ground, the mining tunnels, the subsidence that no amount of iron pylons could fully correct. If the sappers were not on the western approach, they were either being held in reserve or already underground, and the silence from below was either good news or the worst news he would receive today.

He filed it. The western flank was a problem for the next hour. The eastern breach was a problem for the next five minutes.

---

The gate assault hit at the second bell.

The war cry first — the deep, guttural roar of three hundred orc warriors hitting the Veil's Throat at a dead run, their voices merging into a single sustained note that was part rage and part the sound a thousand years of survival made when it was compressed into the width of a killing ground and pointed at a door.

The Throat did what it was designed to do. Fifty feet wide, two hundred feet long, flanked by walls of stone and iron that turned the approach into a channel. The murder holes opened. Oil cascaded down the flank walls in sheets. The archers fired from the bastions — measured two-second intervals, each arrow currency being spent rather than anger being expressed.

The first rank went down. The second ran over them. The third was at the gate.

Rams. Iron-banded timber carried by eight warriors apiece. The impact shuddered through the wall. Stoneveil felt it in his feet, transmitted through the stone — a physical fact that climbed his spine and settled behind his sternum where the other impacts lived. The Anvil. Ashgate. Every blow he had absorbed and converted into the next order.

The rune-wards flared. Blue-white lattice across the gate's surface, ancient symbols pushing back with a force the vocabulary of siege engineering did not accommodate. The ram bounced — a foot, two — enough to stagger the carriers. In the half-second of their stagger the archers sent a volley into the ram crew and three of the eight went down.

New hands took the ram. The gate absorbed another blow.

"Gate holding?"

"Holding, sir. Wards intact. No fracture lines, no degradation."

"The eastern bastion?"

Veyne turned to a different runner — a woman, older, steadier, carrying the expression of someone who had been delivering bad news all morning and had stopped apologising for it.

"Rune-ward fracture along the bastion's lower face. Yesterday's blast compromised the ward matrix at the join. The rune-smiths are patching it, but they need time."

"How long?"

"Two hours for a stable patch. Six for full restoration."

"They have one."

Veyne made a note on her slate. The stylus moved in her quick, efficient strokes — a habit he'd watched for years and still found reassuring, the way a drowning man found the edge of a boat reassuring. Not because it would save him. Because it meant someone was keeping track.

---

The morning was a ledger.

The eastern breach held. Grieve's auxiliaries arrived barely in time, and the Ironborn pushed the orcs off the parapet in a fight that lasted eleven minutes and cost four defenders dead and nine wounded. The auxiliaries, to their credit, did not break. They stood behind the Ironborn and held the ladders at the base with shields and spears and the specific, terrified determination of men discovering the gap between what they had imagined and what was actually happening.

Stoneveil filed this. The auxiliaries could fight. Not well. Not long. But they could fight.

The western flank remained quiet. Small groups of orc warriors testing the defences, pulling back when the response came, measuring reaction times and deployment patterns. Reconnaissance, not assault. The real push on the west would come later, when the defenders' attention was fixed on the gate and the east, and the goblin sappers surfaced from wherever they were digging.

Stoneveil knew this because it was what he would have done. The silence on the west was not comfort. It was patience — someone else's, measured against his own, and the question was whose ran out first.

The gate took eleven ram strikes before the orc commander pulled the assault back. The wards held. The Throat was choked with dead — orc warriors piled in the corridor like driftwood after a flood.

Stoneveil counted them from the rampart. Forty-three.

The number hit him before he could stop it. Forty-three orc dead in the Throat, and forty-three children dead in the Anvil, and the symmetry was not real, was not significant, was a coincidence of arithmetic that his mind should have processed and discarded.

He discarded it. The gap between filing and forgetting was a distance he had learned to maintain.

"Casualty report."

Veyne consulted her slate. "Twenty-seven dead. Forty-one wounded, of which nineteen can return to the wall after treatment. Six critical — unlikely to survive the day."

Twenty-seven from eight hundred and fifty left eight hundred and twenty-three. Nineteen returning brought it to eight hundred and forty-two effective. The six criticals dead by evening: eight hundred and seventeen. And tomorrow another assault, another number, and the ledger would balance again until it balanced for the last time.

"Enemy casualties?"

"Estimated one hundred and sixty. One hundred confirmed dead in the Throat and at the base of the eastern wall."

Six to one. In the doctrine, a defensive victory. The doctrine did not account for the fact that the attacker had twenty-five hundred warriors and the defender had eight hundred and seventeen. At six to one, Stoneveil could kill every orc on the ridge and still run out of men before they ran out of bodies.

"Rotation. First through fourth sections, four-hour relief. Pull the eastern auxiliaries off the wall and replace with Legionnaires from reserve. The auxiliaries need rest before they crack."

"Sir, that leaves the reserve at—"

"I know what it leaves the reserve at, Captain."

She closed her mouth. Not from rebuke. The calculation was already running behind her eyes, arriving at the same number, and the number did not require discussion.

"Replacement auxiliaries to reserve. First section to the eastern wall. Ironborn maintain positions. Gate section holds as deployed."

"And the war-mages?"

"Rotation with the sections. Keep the pairs on the bastions. When the ward patch is complete, redistribute the freed rune-smiths to the eastern towers — whatever enchantments they can lay on the stonework before the next assault."

Veyne wrote. The stylus moved. The ledger updated.

---

The second assault came at midday. It was harder.

The bombardment preceded it — two hours of sustained fire, the catapults and the Jawbreaker pounding the eastern wall every forty seconds. The rune-ward patch held. Barely. The rune-smiths reported stress fractures forming in the repair matrix — the old dwarven work resisting the new the way a body resists a transplant.

The infantry hit the eastern wall and the gate simultaneously. Same geometry as the morning — the fist and the fingers — but tighter. Ladders went up faster. Ram crews were larger, warriors more heavily armoured, shields overlapping into a testudo that deflected arrows from the bastions. Someone had learned from the morning. Someone had adjusted.

The eastern wall buckled. Not the stone — the line. The replacement Legionnaires were fresh but didn't know the section. They didn't know the dead spots where murder holes couldn't reach, the places where the parapet narrowed and a shield wall had to stagger or lose cohesion. They held. Were pushed. Held again. Were pushed again.

A ladder established on the parapet. Ironclaw heavy infantry — tooth-and-bone insignia of the warbands that had fought at Stonehaven — reached the top and met the Legionnaires in the confined space of the wall's crown. No room to swing. No room to manoeuvre. Two lines pressing against each other in a space eight feet wide, shields grinding, blades finding gaps between armour plates, the intimate, grinding violence of men killing each other at a distance closer than a handshake.

The Legionnaires were trained. The orcs were stronger.

Stoneveil watched the breach from the gate rampart. He could see the pocket expanding — the line bowing inward as more orcs crested the ladder and pushed into the wedge of parapet they had claimed. Three feet of his wall. Five. Eight. Ironclaw warriors with their backs to the crenellations, weapons doing the work that weapons did.

He did not send reinforcements. Not yet. The reserve was thin. The auxiliaries were resting. The western flank was quiet and that quiet was getting louder.

"Ballista three."

Veyne understood. "Tower three, sir? They'll be firing into—"

"Into the ladder point. The orcs on the parapet are supplied from below. Cut the supply. The men on the wall can handle what's already up."

The ballista on tower three adjusted its aim. The first bolt hit the ladder's base — iron and wood, propelled with a force that punched through timber and into the warriors clustered at the foot. The ladder buckled. The supply of orcs onto the parapet stopped.

The pocket — cut off, surrounded, outnumbered — lasted four more minutes.

The last orc on the parapet took two spears and a sword thrust and went backward over the crenellation. Forty feet to the base of the wall without making a sound. The Legionnaires reformed. The gap closed. The line held.

"Eastern breach contained."

"Casualties?"

"Eight dead. Fourteen wounded."

Eight more. Eight hundred and nine effective, once the morning's wounded rotation was factored. Tomorrow it would be fewer. The day after, fewer still.

The gate held again. The wards held. The Throat added another layer of dead to the ones already cooling in its shadows, and the afternoon began with the silence that followed the second withdrawal — not peace, not calm, but the held breath of an army that had been pushed back twice and was deciding how hard to push a third time.

---

Stoneveil ate standing up.

Salt meat. Hard bread. Water that tasted of iron — the pipes that fed the rampart cisterns ran through the wall's core, and the bombardment had shaken sediment loose. He chewed. Swallowed. Did not taste.

The sun had moved behind the smoke — the permanent column from the outer ring, thicker now with the fires from the bombardment. The light was amber. Wrong. It had been wrong since the siege began and would stay wrong until the smoke cleared, and the smoke would not clear until the fires went out, and the fires would not go out until one side ran out of men.

"The Emberheart?"

Veyne understood the question. "No communication from Lord Commander Blackthorn since yesterday's dispatch. The Ironbound Guard remains at the Gauntlet Grounds. No change in deployment."

He did not react. Reaction was a resource, and he spent it only where it changed the outcome.

"Supplies."

"Arrows at seventy per cent. Ballista bolts at sixty. Alchemy stores at fifty-five per cent."

"At current expenditure rate?"

"Three days. Four if we reduce the oil to half-rations."

"Reduce to half-rations on the oil. Conserve alchemy stores for gate approaches. Eastern and western walls fight with steel and arrow."

"Sir."

He chewed the salt meat. Finished it. Folded the cloth. Placed it in his pocket — the small, controlled motions of a man who maintained discipline in the details because the details were the last things left that he could control.

The rune-wards pulsed. Dimmer than yesterday. Each impact leaching a fraction of the enchantment, the dwarven work giving up stored power in increments too small to see and too large to ignore. The rune-smiths could patch and restore, but they could not replace what the wards were spending. The enchantment was finite — laid into the stone by artisans who understood the craft at a depth the human rune-smiths could only approximate.

The wards would fail. Not today. Not tomorrow. But they would fail. The gate would go from enchanted iron to ordinary iron, and ordinary iron broke. That was the mathematics beneath the mathematics — the one he carried alone, because speaking it aloud would spend a resource the garrison could not afford.

Stoneveil looked at the approach. The Throat carpeted with dead. The killing ground scarred with catapult impacts. The ridge, where the orc commander was doing the same arithmetic. Counting his dead. Measuring the gap between what the siege had cost and what it had gained. Adjusting.

The machine worked. The deployments held. The rotations held. Sections fought their fights and reported their dead and went back to the wall. The doctrine worked. The training worked. The walls worked.

The numbers were wrong. They had been wrong since Blackthorn's dispatch, since the first scout report six months ago when the smoke on the ridge was a thread and the Ironclaw were a possibility rather than a certainty. The machine would process the inputs — the dead, the wounded, the consumed supplies, the degrading wards — and produce the outputs: positions held, sections rotated, orders given. The machine did not know or care that the inputs were exceeding the outputs at a rate that could not be sustained.

It ran until it broke.

---

The third assault did not come.

The orc commander had pulled back to the ridge. Licking wounds. Counting dead. Reconsidering. That was the rational assessment, and Stoneveil accepted it because it was the assessment that allowed him to rotate his defenders and rest his wounded and begin the repairs the day's fighting had made necessary.

But the silence had a weight to it. The same weight as the silence after the Anvil. Not peace. Reloading.

He stood on the rampart as the sun went down behind the smoke. The wards pulsed. The amber light faded to rust and the rust faded to the grey that was Emberfall's version of twilight — the death of a day spent in blood and iron and the meticulous arithmetic of a man holding a wall with numbers that would never add up.

Eight hundred and nine. The number sat behind his ribs the way the forty-three sat — not as a fact but as a weight. A debt he was accumulating, name by name, against a ledger that had no column for what was owed.

He had not slept. He would not sleep tonight. The wall needed the man who did the math no one else would do, who carried the answers no one else would carry, who stood on the rampart and understood that the arithmetic would balance eventually.

With an answer.

You watch what you order.

The dark came in. The wards pulsed. The silence reloaded.

And the Warden of the Sundered Gate stood on his wall and waited for tomorrow.
