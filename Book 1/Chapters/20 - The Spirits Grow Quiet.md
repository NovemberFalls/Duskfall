# CHAPTER TWENTY: THE SPIRITS GROW QUIET

## Day 5 — The Anvil

---

The alleys swallowed warriors whole.

Thokk stood at the entrance to a street that had no name — the sign ripped from its bracket, the iron post bent at the base where something heavy had hit it, the letters lost in the rubble that choked the roadway. The street ran south, narrow, flanked by the shell-buildings that made up the Anvil District's interior — the forge-shops and worker quarters that the humans had built for industry and that the firebombing had gutted and that the human commander had turned into killing positions.

Twelve warriors had gone down that street thirty minutes ago. Four had come back.

Thokk looked at the four. They sat against the wall of a collapsed building, breathing in the shallow, rapid rhythm of men whose bodies had been operating on the reserves behind the reserves for five days. Two were wounded — one with a bolt through his forearm, the shaft snapped at both ends, the broadhead still embedded; the other pressing a hand against her side where something had opened the armour and the flesh beneath.

"Report."

The senior warrior — a woman named Kezzra, one of Gharza's, her face a mask of soot and dried blood — looked up at him. Her eyes held the particular flatness of a fighter who had seen the inside of a building turn into an abattoir and had walked back out.

"Da buildings, Blood-Chief. Dey're in da buildings. Arrow slits in da walls. Bolt-holes. Da humans cut holes in da stone — small, low, you can't see dem until da arrows come through. We go down da street and dey hit us from both sides, and when we try to go through da doors da doors are blocked and da windows are too narrow and da walls are dwarf-stone and da axe bounces off it like hitting a mountain."

"Barricades?"

"Three. One at da end of da street, two at da cross-junctions. Rubble and timber, chest-high, angled so da crossfire comes from every direction." She paused. The pause was not hesitation — it was the act of deciding how to say the next thing. "Da rubble is black, Blood-Chief. Burned stone. Dey built deir walls from deir own fire."

Thokk had heard this from Krogan. From Malga. From every War-Chief who had led warriors into the Anvil District since dawn. The same report, delivered in different words but carrying the same weight: the district was a trap. Not the kind of trap that was designed — not the cunning, mechanical ambush that goblin engineers built. The kind that grew organically from the intersection of geography and desperation and a commander who understood that ruins were not ruins if you put men with bows behind them.

The human commander had turned his atrocity into a fortress.

"How many dead?" Thokk asked.

"Eight. Ironclaw. Dere are goblins too — a sapper crew went into da building on da left. I heard da charges go off. Didn't see dem come out."

Eight more. Added to the morning's count, to the afternoon's count, to the ledger that the locked room carried. Thokk did not do the arithmetic. Not here. Not in front of warriors who needed to see a Warlord, not an abacus.

"Fall back to da staging point. Get da bolt out of Tarn's arm. I want yer squad rested for two hours."

Kezzra looked at him. "We can go back in. Dere's a gap in da—"

"Two hours, Kezzra."

She closed her mouth. Not from obedience — from the recognition that the voice carrying the order was the voice that had carried every order for five days, and the voice was not asking.

The four warriors rose. Moved north, toward the staging area Krogan had established behind the outer wall's breach. They moved slowly — not from exhaustion alone, but from the particular, weighted gait of people who had entered a place with twelve and left with four and the leaving carried the eight they'd left behind.

Thokk watched them go.

Then he looked at the street.

---

The Anvil District was worse than the walls.

Thokk had known it would be. The walls were the walls — vertical surfaces defended by men on top, attacked by men below, the geometry of siege as old as the first stone stacked on another stone. Walls were honest. They told you what they cost before you paid. You looked at the height and the width and the men behind them and you did the arithmetic and the arithmetic was the arithmetic and the answer was the answer, and you either accepted the answer or you found another way or you walked away.

The Anvil did not have answers. The Anvil had corners.

Every corner was a question. Every doorway was a question. Every window — the ones that still held glass and the ones that didn't and the ones that had been widened into arrow slits by the hands of soldiers who understood that the difference between a window and a murder hole was a chisel and ten minutes — was a question, and the answer came in iron and the answer always came too late.

His warriors were dying in alleys.

Not on the wall, where death had a shape — the ladder, the parapet, the moment when the shield went up and the blade came down and the fall was forty feet to stone. On the wall, the dying had a rhythm. A warrior on a wall knew where the killing came from. He could see the man who would kill him. He could choose the moment and the manner and the angle, and the choosing was a kind of power, even if the choice was the last one he ever made.

In the alleys, the dying came from everywhere.

From the arrow slits in the blackened walls. From the barricades that blocked the street at every junction. From the rooftops — or what was left of the rooftops, the partial structures that provided elevation and cover and the angle that turned a bowman into a god and a warband into a killing floor. From the doorways that were sealed and the doorways that weren't and the difference between the two was the difference between cover and catastrophe and you couldn't tell which was which until you tried.

Thokk had fought in cities before. At Stonehaven, where the dwarven tunnels had made the underground a battlefield and the surface a secondary concern. At the border forts along the ridgeline, where the cramped corridors and low ceilings had negated the Ironclaw's reach advantage and turned every engagement into a knife fight. He understood urban combat the way he understood every form of killing — not as a specialist, but as a leader who had watched enough of his people die in enough places to recognise the patterns.

The Anvil was different.

The Anvil was a place that had been destroyed once and had learned from the destroying. The firebombing had gutted the buildings but left the walls. The walls were dwarf-stone — three feet thick, the dense basalt that the dwarven craftsmen had quarried for their forges, the stone that absorbed heat and impact and time and did not break. The fire had taken everything that wasn't stone, and what remained was a district of empty rooms enclosed by walls that were stronger than anything Thokk's warriors could carry through the streets.

And the human commander had understood this. Had understood that the ruins were not a liability but an asset. That a gutted building with arrow slits was a better fighting position than an intact building with windows. That a street choked with rubble was a better barricade than a wall, because rubble had no gate and no hinge and no weakness that could be exploited by a battering ram or a goblin charge.

The commander had turned the destruction into defense. Thokk recognised the intelligence because the intelligence was the same intelligence he would have used. The same cold, practical efficiency of a leader who looked at what he had and made it serve.

*Ghar-rukk*. The wound that builds the wall.

He had named it on Day 4, standing at the Sundered Gate, looking inward at the middle ring. He had named it without knowing what it meant. Now, on Day 5, standing at the entrance to a street that had eaten twelve of his warriors and returned four, he understood.

The human commander was not hiding behind the wreckage. He was fighting from it. Using it. Every burned building, every collapsed floor, every piece of rubble that the firebombing had produced — it was material. It was the raw stuff of defense, the same way ore was the raw stuff of steel. The commander had taken the worst thing he had ever done and forged it into the thing that would save his city.

And Thokk was sending his people into it.

---

Grimtusk found him at the crossroads.

The crossroads was the intersection of two streets that had once had names and no longer did — the signs gone, the cobblestones cracked, the junction cleared by Ironclaw warriors who had pushed through the initial resistance and established a foothold two hours ago. The foothold was tenuous — the buildings on three sides were occupied by human defenders who had pulled back to the secondary positions, and the fourth side was the street where Kezzra's squad had lost eight.

Thokk was looking south when Grimtusk spoke.

"Da spirits have gone quiet."

The words arrived without preamble. Grimtusk did not do preamble — not today, not after five days of casting bones that showed less and less, of reading signs that grew dimmer the way the rune-wards on the Sundered Gate had grown dimmer, the light fading not from any single cause but from the slow, patient exhaustion of the thing that powered it.

Thokk did not turn.

"Quiet how?"

"Not quiet like before." Grimtusk moved to stand beside him. The old shaman was leaning on his staff — the gnarled ironwood that he had carried for thirty years, carved with the spiraling script of the ancestors, the wood darkened by blood and oil and the smoke of a thousand pyres. He was leaning on it more today. The staff was doing work that the legs had done yesterday. "Before, dey were confused. Restless. Quiet da way a room is quiet when someone is in it but not speaking."

"And now?"

"Now da room is empty."

Thokk looked at him. Grimtusk's milky grey eyes were fixed on the street ahead — the narrow corridor between the burned buildings, the place where the light came through in slants and the dust hung in the air and the shadows were the kind of shadows that moved when nothing was moving.

"Empty," Thokk repeated.

"I cast da bones dis morning. Before da assault." Grimtusk reached into the leather pouch at his waist — the same pouch, the same wolf knuckles, the tools of a practice as old as the Ironclaw themselves. His hands moved differently today. Slower. Not from age — from the way a man's hands moved when he was reaching for something and was not sure it would be there.

He opened his palm. Three wolf knuckles lay in the scarred, grey-green flesh, the bones small and smooth, the surfaces dark with the patina of use.

"Dey fell cold," Grimtusk said. "Not warm. Not da heat of da spirits pushing through. Cold. Like da fire went out in da channel between dis world and da one beneath."

"Da fire doesn't go out."

"It didn't. Not fully. I felt — something. At da edge. Da way you feel warmth from a fire dat's burned to coals, the heat still dere but thin, fading. Da spirits are not gone, Blood-Chief. But dey're..." He searched for the word the way he had searched on the first night, on the ridge above the camp, his hands hovering over the bones in the ash. But on the first night, the word had been there — *confused*, he had said, and the word had been adequate. Today the word was not there, or it was there but it was the wrong shape for the thing it was trying to describe.

"Far," he said. "Dey feel far."

Thokk turned the wolf knuckles over in his own hand. They were cold. He had held them before — after the first day, when Grimtusk had given him the cracked bone, the one that sat in his pouch beside the old Warlord's skull. Those bones had been warm. The spiritual charge, Grimtusk had called it — the residual energy of the ancestors, the current that flowed through the casting tools the way blood flowed through a living body.

These bones felt like stone. Like any other bone. Like the remains of something that had been alive and was not alive and carried nothing of the living in its surface.

"Da rites," Thokk said. "For da dead."

"I performed dem dis morning. Da pyres burned." Grimtusk took the bones back. Held them in his closed fist, the gesture of a man protecting something fragile — not the bones themselves, which were hard and ancient and had survived more than any shaman, but the connection they represented. The thread between the living and the dead that the bones were supposed to carry and that the bones were no longer carrying.

"Da smoke rose. Da words were spoken. But I did not feel da passage. Not da way I felt it before — da weight lifting, da spirits receiving, da sense dat da dead were going somewhere and da somewhere was real." He was quiet for a moment. The staff took more of his weight. "Da dead went into da fire. What came out of da fire was smoke. Just smoke."

Just smoke.

Thokk looked south, down the street where the buildings closed in and the light thinned. Somewhere ahead, the human barricades waited. Behind them, the defenders. Behind them, the southern edge of the district and the civilian shelters and the inner ring beyond. Layers. One behind the next, like the rings of the city itself — walls behind walls behind walls, and the breaking of each one revealed another, and the another was the same and different and worse.

"What does it mean?"

He asked the question because the question was the only honest thing he could do. Not for himself — Thokk did not need the spirits to tell him what to do. The arithmetic was the arithmetic. The food was the food. The warriors were the warriors, and the wall ahead was the wall ahead, and the children at Bloodtide Bay were the children at Bloodtide Bay, and none of these things required spiritual guidance. They required the same thing they had always required: a man willing to spend the blood to pay the price.

He asked for Grimtusk. Because Grimtusk had spent forty years listening to voices that had always answered, and the silence that was filling the space where the voices had been was a wound that no battle could inflict and no bone-ash could heal.

"I don't know." Grimtusk's voice was flat. Not the flatness of a man withholding — the flatness of a man who had reached the bottom of what he knew and found it bare. "Da connections between da living world and da spirit world are... thinning is not da word anymore. Thinning is what happens to roots in bad soil. Dis is what happens to roots when da soil is gone."

"Da corruption."

"Maybe. Da Veilfire — da thing in da north, da rot dat's spreading through da deep places — it touches everything. Da ground. Da water. Da connections dat da shamans use to speak to da ancestors." He looked at Thokk. The milky eyes held something that Thokk had never seen in them before. Not fear. Fear was for men who had something left to lose. This was the expression of a man who was losing the thing he could not name, the thing that was not his life or his power or his standing but the thing underneath all of those, the foundation that made the rest of the structure possible.

"Da spirits are not gone," Grimtusk said again. "I believe dat. I feel dem — at da edges, in da quiet, da way you hear water running underground. Dey're dere. But da channel between us and dem is narrowing so fast dat what passes through is less each day. Less guidance. Less warmth. Less—" He stopped. "Less presence. Da ancestors are pulling away. Not from us. From da world."

"From Bloodhollow."

"Yes."

The word sat between them the way the numbers sat — heavy, patient, occupying the space that other words might have filled. Thokk turned it over. The spirits pulling away from Bloodhollow. The connections thinning. The channel between the living and the dead narrowing to a crack through which only silence passed.

He thought about the pyres. Five days of pyres. Two hundred and forty-nine Ironclaw dead — the number from last night, before today's count, before the street that took eight and the alleys that took however many the morning's full assault had taken. He thought about the smoke that had risen from those pyres, and the words Grimtusk had spoken over them, and the feeling he had carried from each pyre-night — the ancestor-weight, the spiritual presence that pressed against the living world like a hand against glass.

That feeling was gone.

He had noticed it last night. The pyre had burned — the twenty-three warriors who had died taking the initial breach in the Anvil's wall, their bodies laid in rows, their foreheads marked, their hearts touched. The fire had risen. Grimtusk had spoken. And the feeling — the electrical charge, the warmth beneath the warmth, the presence — had been absent. Not diminished. Absent. The fire had burned like fire burned, consuming what it touched and producing smoke and heat and light and nothing else. Just fire. Just smoke.

He had not spoken of it. Not last night, not this morning. Some truths needed time to arrive, the way some wounds needed time to declare themselves — the initial impact masked by the body's refusal to acknowledge what the body had already understood.

The spirits had gone quiet.

The door between the living and the dead was closing.

---

Krogan brought the morning count at midday.

The War-Chief looked like a man who had been fed through a forge and extruded through the other side — thinner, harder, the softness of flesh stripped away until what remained was bone and will and the particular, indestructible stubbornness of an orc who had fought five days of siege and would fight five more because the alternative was the thing he did not name.

His scalp wound had reopened. The black gut stitches from Day 2 had torn — the skin pulling apart under the strain of whatever blow had landed this morning, the blood running in a fresh line down the old channel, the groove of the ancient scar, the two wounds — original and renewal — tracing the same path because the body remembered its injuries the way the city remembered its fires.

"Thirty-six Ironclaw dead since dawn," Krogan said. "Nineteen goblins."

Thirty-six. In six hours of fighting. The alleys were eating them faster than the wall had.

Thokk let the number enter the locked room. He did not calculate the total — not here, not in front of Krogan, whose eyes already held the arithmetic of a man who had counted his own dead and the dead of his warband and the dead of his son and was carrying the sum of all of them in the space behind the ribs that was getting full.

"Da breach?"

"Holding. We've pushed three blocks into da district. Main avenue, Forge Road, da side street dat Malga's vanguard cleared at dawn." Krogan's deep voice carried the report the way it carried everything — flat, steady, the bass note that anchored the conversation to the ground. "But da push is stalling. Every block, dey've got positions. Every junction, barricades. Da buildings are fortified — arrow slits, bolt-holes, choke points. We take one building and da next building fires into us while we're clearing. We clear dat one and da next does da same."

"Da siege engines?"

"Skrixx is firing over da wall. His catapults can hit da secondary barricade from da ridge, but da angles are wrong — da rounds are hitting da buildings, not da positions. He says he needs to move da engines closer."

"He needs to survive long enough to move dem. Da ballista on da inner ring is targeting his positions."

"Yah." Krogan paused. "Dere's something else."

Thokk waited.

"Da humans are fighting different." Krogan's jaw moved — the motion of a man chewing on words that did not want to be swallowed. "On da walls, dey fought like soldiers. Disciplined. Organised. Rotations. Counter-attacks. Da thing you'd expect from a garrison defending a fixed position."

"And now?"

"Now dey fight like something else. Dere's no rotation. Dere's no retreat. Dey put men in a building and da men stay until da building falls or dey do. I took a forge-shop on da eastern side — four humans inside. Dey didn't pull back when we breached da door. Dey fought in da room. In da dark. Wit knives, at da end, when da swords were gone."

With knives. In the dark. Thokk understood what that meant. It meant the human commander had given the order that every commander eventually gave in a siege: hold at all costs. It meant the defenders had stopped retreating because there was nowhere left to retreat to that was not the last wall, and the last wall was too valuable to give up ground to reach.

It meant the defenders were fighting the way the Ironclaw were fighting. Not for victory. For survival. The mirror again — the recognition that had sat in his chest since Day 3, the understanding that the difference between the two armies was not cause or courage but position, and position was geography, and geography was the accident that put you on one side of the wall instead of the other.

"Da Revenants?" Thokk asked.

"In da main avenue. Fifty of dem. Holding da line while da warbands rotate." Krogan's voice carried a shade of something that was not quite disgust and not quite acceptance — the middle ground that the Ironclaw had found for the dead things that fought beside them. "Dey don't care about da arrow slits. Dey walk through da crossfire and dey don't fall. Da humans put eight bolts in one and it kept walking. Took a human's head off wit a mace dat was older dan da wall."

Fifty Revenants in the avenue. The dead things holding the line while the living rested. Efficient. Practical. The same calculation Thokk had made on Day 4 — spend the expendable to preserve the valuable, use the dead to save the living, put the things without futures in front of the things that still had one.

The calculation sat wrong. It had sat wrong since the beginning, since the first day he had looked at the Revenants standing at the edge of the camp with their grey skin and their hollow eyes and their weapons that were older than memory. They were tools. He used them because the arithmetic demanded it and the arithmetic was the only voice that spoke clearly anymore.

But the spirits were quiet, and the spirits had always been the thing that separated the Ironclaw from the Revenants — the connection to the ancestors, the warmth in the bones, the presence that said *you are alive and the living matter and the living carry the dead forward into the future.* Without that connection, without the spirits, the line between the living warriors and the dead ones was thinner than Thokk wanted it to be.

"Keep dem in da avenue," he said. "Rotating warbands on da side streets. I don't want da Revenants in da alleys — dey don't read corners, dey don't adapt, dey walk straight and da alleys kill anything dat walks straight."

"And da push?"

Thokk looked south. The street. The corners. The buildings that were shells and fortresses and graves.

"We keep pushing. Block by block. Clear da buildings. Take da barricades. Da commander is fighting from fixed positions — dat means he can't move. We're slower but we're mobile. Every position we take is a position he can't replace."

"Da cost," Krogan said.

The word arrived the way it always arrived — flat, unadorned, the simplest word in the language for the thing that was not simple at all. The cost. Thirty-six dead this morning. Eight more in Kezzra's street. The number climbing the way smoke climbed from a pyre — steadily, visibly, with the patient inevitability of a thing that would not stop until it had consumed everything that fed it.

"I know da cost," Thokk said.

Krogan looked at him. The assessment was the same assessment that every War-Chief performed on a Warlord who had been leading for five days — the weighing of what remained against what was needed, the question that lived behind the loyalty: *is he still holding?*

Whatever Krogan saw, it was enough. He nodded — the single, downward motion of a head too heavy with grief to repeat the gesture. He turned and walked north, toward the staging area, toward his warband, toward the warriors who needed to see their War-Chief walk upright through the ruins and take the walking as evidence that the war was not over.

Thokk watched him go.

Thirty-six and eight. Forty-four today. Added to the two hundred and forty-nine, the total was two hundred and ninety-three Ironclaw dead. Not counting the goblins — Skrixx's losses were separate, recorded in the transactional accounting that goblins favoured, the numbers stripped of everything except quantity and operational impact.

Two hundred and ninety-three. From twelve hundred. Effective Ironclaw strength: somewhere below a thousand — the wounded reducing the number further, the exhaustion reducing it further still, the mathematics of sustained combat subtracting not just the dead but the capacity of the living, the slow erosion that turned an army from a force into a group into a collection of individuals who happened to be dying in the same place.

The food in the supply pits: three days. Maybe two. The scouts had found nothing in the valley — the game gone, the foraging stripped, the land around the siege as barren as the land the Ironclaw had left behind. Three days of march ration for an army that was burning its reserves faster than the ration could replace them.

Three days. And the wall ahead — the next line of barricades, the next layer of the human commander's defense — showed no sign of breaking. The buildings were stone. The positions were entrenched. The defenders were fighting with the concentrated, compressed fury of men whose world had shrunk to the size of a forge-shop and who had decided that the forge-shop was the hill they would die on.

Thokk touched the pouch at his belt. The cracked wolf knuckle and the old Warlord's skull. The bone and the bone. The weight of what had always been there and the weight of what was no longer there — the warmth gone, the spiritual charge spent, the wolf knuckle as cold as the bones Grimtusk had shown him at the crossroads.

He did not know if this meant victory or doom.

The spirits would not say. The spirits could not say. The spirits were far, and the far was getting farther, and the distance between the living and the dead was growing while the distance between the living and the dying was shrinking.

He pushed forward because there was no backward.

---

Malga was dying.

She didn't say so. She would not say so. She was Malga Bonefist — the woman who had led the vanguard at four sieges and walked out of each one with new scars and fewer warriors and the grin that said *I went first and I'm still here.* She did not discuss the things that hurt her. She discussed the things that needed killing and the order in which they needed to be killed and the specific, operational details of the killing itself.

But the arm was finished.

Thokk saw it when she came to report at the crossroads. The wound from Day 2 — the one she had bandaged herself, the crude wrap that had been replaced by the shaman's work and then torn open and re-wrapped and torn open again through four days of fighting — was no longer a wound. It was an event. The flesh above the elbow was swollen to twice its size, the skin stretched and discoloured, the veins black beneath the surface in the pattern that said the blood was poisoned and the poison was spreading.

She gave her report with the arm at her side. Not hanging — held. Held in place by the will that had held it in place since Day 2, the will that refused to acknowledge that the arm was no longer an arm but a liability, a weight that consumed energy the body did not have.

"Vanguard pushed two blocks south on Forge Road. Took da big forge-shop — da one wit da double chimneys. Four humans inside. Dey fought." The grin was there. Not the old grin — thinner, the edges worn, the expression of a woman who was running out of the thing that the grin was made from. "We lost six taking it. But da position gives us line of sight to da secondary barricade. I can see deir command post."

"Deir command post?"

"Da big forge. Centre of da district. Dere's a man standing in da gap in da roof — watching. He stands dere da way you stand on da ridge. Watching. Planning. Giving orders."

The human commander. Standing in the forge where the Forge-King had died, using the building where the atrocity had begun as the place from which the defense was directed. Thokk did not know the specifics — did not know the forge's name or the Forge-King's name or the forty-three. He knew the shape. The wound that built the wall.

"Can Skrixx hit it?"

"Maybe. Da angle is steep — da catapults on da ridge would have to arc over da outer wall and da buildings between. But if he can find da range, one good round through dat gap in da roof and da commander is gone. And if da commander goes..." She didn't finish. She didn't need to.

Thokk looked at her arm.

"See da shamans."

"After—"

"Now, Malga."

She looked at him. The grin faded. Not from pain — from the recognition that the voice was the same voice that had told Kezzra to rest, the voice that did not ask, the voice of a Warlord who was watching one of his War-Chiefs die on her feet and was not willing to let the dying continue unchallenged.

"Da arm is fine."

"Da arm is poisoned. Da veins are black. I can see dem from here, Malga."

She looked at the arm. Looked at it the way a warrior looked at a weapon that had failed — with the assessment of function rather than sentiment. The assessment was clear. The arm was not fine. The arm was killing her, slowly, the infection that the siege's chaos had prevented the shamans from treating properly now established in the flesh and the blood and the marrow.

"If dey take it off," she said. Her voice was flat. Not the flatness of acceptance — the flatness of a woman who had considered the possibility and found it preferable to the alternative. "I can still fight. Left hand. I fought left at da crossing in Year 94. My shield work is better left-sided anyway."

"See da shamans. Dat's an order."

Malga Bonefist held his gaze for a moment that lasted longer than most of Malga's moments, which was to say it lasted nearly three seconds. Then she nodded — not the grin-nod, not the sharp, eager acknowledgment of a vanguard commander receiving an assignment. The other nod. The slower one. The one that said: *I hear you, and I'm going, and da going is not a retreat from da fight but a pause in it, and da pause is because you asked and I have not yet refused you anything.*

She walked north. The arm hung at her side. She did not hold it anymore.

Thokk watched her go and carried the image in the locked room — Malga Bonefist walking away from a crossroads in a ruined district with her arm dying and her grin dying and the vanguard that had been three hundred now fewer than a hundred and fifty and the woman who led them walking with the stride of someone who was counting the steps she had left and was planning to use them all.

---

The afternoon assault stalled at the secondary barricade.

Thokk watched it from the double-chimney forge-shop that Malga's vanguard had taken — the position that gave line of sight to the barricade, two hundred paces south, the wall of rubble and timber that stretched across the main approach and served as the human commander's second line.

The barricade was well-built. Better than the first. The first had been hasty — the work of soldiers who had been retreating and building simultaneously, the construction reflecting the urgency. The second barricade had been built with time. Not much time — a day, maybe less — but time enough for the human engineers to fit the stones properly, to angle the timber bracing, to create the crossfire corridors that turned the approach into a killing ground.

Gharza's western warband hit it first. One hundred and thirty warriors — what remained of the two hundred and fifty she had started with — charging the barricade's eastern edge where a gap between the wall and a collapsed building offered a potential flank.

The gap was a trap.

Thokk saw it the moment Gharza's warriors committed. The gap was deliberate — left by the human engineers, the opening too convenient, too obvious, the invitation that a commander laid when he wanted the enemy to come to a specific place and the specific place was the place where the killing was most efficient.

The crossfire came from three positions. The forge-shops on either side of the gap — the ones the humans had fortified, the arrow slits cut low, the bolts arriving at waist height because waist height was where the armour was thinnest and the flesh was softest. Gharza's warriors hit the gap and the gap hit them back, the fire converging from three angles simultaneously, the first rank going down in the first three seconds, the second rank stumbling over the first, the charge's momentum carrying warriors into the corridor and the corridor filling with the sound of iron on flesh and the sound of men discovering that the place they had chosen to fight was the place they had been chosen to die.

Gharza pulled them back. She was at the rear — the position she had taken since the street fighting began, not from cowardice but from the tactical understanding that the commander who went first was the commander who died first, and dead commanders could not redirect the living. She pulled them back with the shouted commands and the physical, hands-on control that was Gharza's particular skill — grabbing collars, pushing shoulders, the brutal, personal authority of a War-Chief who communicated withdrawal not as an order but as a force.

Fourteen dead in the gap. Two minutes. Seven per minute.

Thokk watched from the forge-shop. The observation point that Malga's cost had purchased — six Ironclaw dead for the position, the position providing the sight lines, the sight lines providing the intelligence that the gap was a trap and the barricade was defended and the defenders were fighting from three positions simultaneously and the three positions covered every approach to the barricade's face.

"Da barricade holds," he said to Grimtusk.

The old shaman stood behind him. The staff took his weight. His milky eyes were not watching the barricade — they were watching something else, something in the air or the space between the air, the thing that shaman eyes saw that was not visible to the eyes that lived in the physical world.

"Da dead are piling up," Grimtusk said.

"I know."

"Not da way you know. Da way I know." He leaned on the staff. "Dis many dead, dis fast, dis close together — da spiritual weight is... heavy. Da dead need da rites. Dey need da passage. And da channel dat carries dem is—"

"Not wide enough."

"Not dere." Grimtusk's voice was quiet. Not the quiet of a man who did not want to be heard — the quiet of a man who was speaking truth that had no volume, truth that existed at the threshold of what words could carry. "Da dead from da alleys. Da dead from da forge-shops. Da warriors dat fell in buildings where da smoke was too thick for anyone to reach dem, where da bodies are still inside, unburned, unmarked. I can feel dem. Not as spirits — as weight. Da weight of da unprocessed dead pressing against a door dat is closing."

The unprocessed dead. Warriors who had died in the alleys and the buildings and the corners of a district that was burning for the second time, whose bodies were still lying where they fell because the fighting was too close and the streets were too dangerous and the rites required time and time was the thing the siege consumed faster than anything else.

Ironclaw warriors, unburned. Unmarked. Without the three lines on their foreheads, without the fist over the heart, without the words that were not the same for any two because the dead were not the same. Without the passage.

Just dead. Like the Revenants.

The thought arrived and Thokk did not push it away. He carried it the way he carried everything — in the locked room, behind the ribs, in the place where the truths that were too heavy for the daylight waited.

His warriors were dying in a place where the dead could not be honoured. Where the rites could not reach. Where the spirits — if the spirits were still listening, if the spirits were still present, if the spirits had not pulled so far from the world that the distance was the same as absence — could not receive the smoke or the words or the marks that told them a warrior had come home.

His warriors were dying, and the dying was becoming the same as the dying of the Revenants — bodies without passage, flesh without fire, the end without the after.

He did not know if this meant victory or doom.

He pushed forward because there was no backward.

Skrixx arrived at dusk.

The goblin moved through the orc positions the way he always moved — fast, erratic, the trajectory of a creature whose natural state was motion and whose relationship to stillness was the same as fire's relationship to stone: temporary, reluctant, and likely to end in something burning.

He smelled worse than usual. The alchemist's fire residue had been supplemented by something new — the sharp, chemical stink of blasting compound mixed with a sweeter, thicker odour that Thokk recognised as blood. Not orcish blood. Not human. Goblin. The blood of Skrixx's own people, the sapper crews who had been under the Anvil District's foundations all day, setting charges that were supposed to bring down the secondary barricade from below.

"Da tunnels are done," Skrixx said. "Three charges set along da barricade's foundation. Da approach runs under da main avenue — forty feet below da surface, through da old sewer system dat da humans built and forgot about."

"Forgot about?"

"Da sewers are pre-firebombing. Da humans sealed da main access but dey didn't seal da secondary branches. My sappers found an entry point two blocks north — a collapsed drain that connects to da old network." The copper eyes blinked. "Da humans down dere sealed da access to da main line. My sappers unsealed it. Dey lost four doing it."

Four more goblins. The number went into the ledger that Thokk maintained for Skrixx's forces — a separate column, because the goblins were allies, not Ironclaw, and the distinction mattered even when the dying didn't distinguish.

"Can ya bring da barricade down?"

"I can bring da street down. Da barricade, da buildings on either side, da fifty feet of cobblestone dat sits on top of da sewer line. All of it." Skrixx grinned — the too-many-teeth expression, the professional satisfaction of a builder who had found the weakness in the structure and was prepared to exploit it. "Da question is timing. Da charges need to be detonated simultaneously — three charges, three fuses, each one timed to da others. If one goes early, da others may not fire. If one goes late, da collapse is partial and da gap isn't wide enough."

"Can yer goblins manage it?"

"My goblins can manage anything dat involves fire and explosions. Da timing is da art. Da art requires —" He hesitated. The hesitation was the same hesitation Thokk had seen at the crossroads when Grimtusk searched for the word that wasn't there. "It requires my best fuse-cutter. And my best fuse-cutter is dead. He was one of da four."

Thokk looked at the goblin. Skrixx's face held the particular expression of a creature who processed loss the way he processed structural failure — as a variable, as an equation to be solved — but whose equation, for once, had arrived at an answer he did not like.

"Who does it, den?"

"I do."

The words arrived flat, without performance. Not brave — practical. The calculation of a mind that had run through the options and found that the only variable remaining was the one that had been building the equations for five days.

"No," Thokk said.

"Blood-Chief—"

"Yer value is in yer head. Not yer hands. I need yer head alive for whatever comes after da barricade."

"Dere is no after da barricade if da barricade doesn't fall. And da barricade doesn't fall if da fuses aren't cut right. And da fuses aren't cut right if da person cutting dem doesn't understand da compound's burn rate and da stone's compression tolerances and da way da sewer's acoustics amplify da detonation wave." He paused. "I do. Nobody else does. Not anymore."

Thokk looked at the goblin who had built the Jawbreaker and the catapults and the fire-pots and the charges that had broken the outer wall. The creature who smelled like smoke and death and chemical innovation, whose burns mapped his body like a record of every risk taken and survived, whose copper eyes moved at a speed that outpaced conversation and whose mind processed the world as an engineering problem that had not yet been solved.

Skrixx Blazebinder. The Pyrelord. The goblin who had broken more walls than any living creature on Bloodhollow and who was now proposing to crawl under a barricade in a sewer with three charges and cut the fuses himself because his best man was dead and the skill required was the skill that could not be replaced.

"Ya survive dis," Thokk said. "Dat's an order."

Skrixx blinked. The copper eyes registered the order the way they registered all orders — as data, as input, as a variable to be accommodated in the equation. Whether the equation's output would comply with the order was a question that neither of them could answer and both of them understood.

"I'll do what da fuses allow," Skrixx said. "Da fuses don't take orders."

He vanished into the dark, trailing smoke-smell and the particular, frenetic energy of a goblin walking toward the thing he was built for.

Thokk watched him go.

The Pyrelord had survived five days. The Pyrelord would survive this, or he would not, and the surviving or the not-surviving would be determined by the same forces that determined everything in the siege: skill, luck, and the mathematics of a world that did not negotiate.

Skrixx would survive. Thokk had to believe this the way he had to believe the children would eat and the wall would fall and the cost, when the counting was done, would be a cost the Ironclaw could bear.

He had to believe it because belief was the only fuel that burned slower than food, and the food was almost gone.

Night.

The pyres burned behind the outer wall — not on the ridge anymore, the ridge too far back, the army too deep in the city to carry the dead that distance. The pyres were built in the square where the Iron Marches met the outer ring, the open ground that had been a marketplace and was now a crematorium. The fires rose against a sky that was the colour of bruised metal, the smoke joining the permanent haze that the siege had draped across Bloodhollow's sky like a second atmosphere.

Thokk did not walk among the dead.

For the first time in five days, he did not perform the rites.

The decision sat in his chest like a blade — the weight of it, the edge of it, the understanding that the decision was correct and the correctness was the worst thing about it. There were too many dead. Too many streets between the pyres and the positions, too much distance to cross in the dark with the human defenders still firing from the buildings and the alleys still swallowing anyone who walked through them without the numbers to force passage.

The dead would burn. Grimtusk's apprentices would speak the words. The bone-ash would be mixed and the marks would be drawn and the smoke would rise.

But the spirits would not receive them. The spirits were far. The channel was closed or closing and the smoke would be smoke and the fire would be fire and the passage would be a ritual performed for the living because the dead could no longer hear it.

Thokk stood at the crossroads and watched the distant glow of the pyres. The warmth of the fire did not reach him. The warmth of the spirits did not reach him. He stood in the cold of the Anvil District — the cold that was not temperature but absence, the cold of a place that had burned and a world that was pulling its dead away from the living and a war that had gone on long enough to exhaust not just the bodies but the thing beneath the bodies, the connection that made the fighting mean something beyond the fighting itself.

He thought about Bloodtide Bay.

The shore camps. The children. The great fires at the turning of the season, when the shamans spoke the old words and the ancestors answered. The ancestors who had always answered. Who had sent their warmth through the bones and the fire and the smoke, who had been present in every death rite and every birth blessing and every casting Grimtusk had performed in forty years of service to the spirits.

The ancestors who were now far. Who were pulling away. Who were leaving the Ironclaw to fight and die and burn without the warmth that had always been the thing that separated the dying from the dead.

He did not know what the silence meant. He did not know if it meant the world was breaking — the corruption, the Veilfire, the rot in the deep places that Grimtusk had spoken of since the march began. He did not know if it meant the spirits had seen the outcome and had chosen not to speak it. He did not know if it meant victory or doom, and the not-knowing was the heaviest thing in the locked room, heavier than the dead, heavier than the food count, heavier than the number seven that had followed him since the first night and still carried its shadow.

Seven. The number Grimtusk had read in the bones, persistent, uninterpretable, attached to something the bones could show but could not explain. Seven strikes. Seven of something. The spirits had screamed it through a crack in a door that was closing, and now the door was closed or nearly closed and the number remained — the last message delivered before the silence came, the final word from the ancestors before the ancestors went far.

He touched the pouch. The cracked wolf knuckle — cold now, always cold, the warmth gone from it the way the warmth had gone from the bones Grimtusk held and the pyres Grimtusk blessed and the world Grimtusk listened to. The old Warlord's skull — smooth, empty, the shell of a leader who had carried the weight and become the weight and passed the weight to the next.

The chain. Skull to skull to skull. An endless succession of leaders who held their people up until their arms gave out. Thokk was the current link. The chain would continue after him — would continue because the Ironclaw would survive, because the wall would fall, because the children would eat, because the cost would be paid and the paying would be finished and the finishing would be worth the dead in the alleys and the dead on the walls and the dead in the pyres that burned without the spirits to receive them.

He had to believe this.

He pushed forward because there was no backward.

The children needed to eat.

The dark came in behind him. The same dark. The same war. But the fire beneath the dark was dimmer now, the coals dying, the channel closing, the spirits pulling away from a world that was spending its dead faster than the dead could be processed and the processing was the thing that kept the dead from being just dead and the living from being just living and the difference between the two from being just a heartbeat that had not yet stopped.

The pyres burned.

The smoke rose.

And the spirits, if they were listening, said nothing.
