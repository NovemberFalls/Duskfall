# CHAPTER FIFTEEN: THE RETREAT

## Day 4 — The Break

---

The order came through screaming.

Not the screaming of men — November had learned the difference. The screaming of men had texture: the wet, ragged sound of a throat producing noise without permission, the high note that meant a wound had reached the place where breath lived, the low, grinding sound that meant a man was still conscious enough to know what was happening to him and too far gone to do anything about it except make the noise that human bodies made when the machinery was failing.

This screaming was stone. The western wall — somewhere behind November's position, out of sight beyond the rooftops of the Iron Marches — had come apart. He felt it through his boots first: the deep, structural vibration of something massive giving way, the foundation of the district shifting by a fraction that was invisible to the eye and unmistakable to the bones. Then the sound arrived — the grinding, tearing collapse of masonry that had stood for a hundred years discovering what it meant to stop standing, followed by the concussive blast of goblin charges detonating in sequence, three of them, the air compressing and releasing with a force that pushed dust through the streets in a rolling wave.

November had been on the south wall. Section Four. The composite unit — what remained of it after three days of assault and attrition — was holding a stretch of parapet between the secondary gate and the eastern bastion. Eighteen men where twenty-three had started. The five who were missing had been subtracted in the particular, individual arithmetic of siege: one to the triage station with an arrow through his calf, two to the reserve when their section was reshuffled, one dead on Day 3 when a scaling ladder he was pushing off snapped and the orc on it fell on top of him, and one who had simply stopped coming to rotation, whose name November knew and whose absence no one explained and no one asked about because asking was a luxury the wall could not afford.

Edric was beside him. Where Edric always was. The boy — no. The Legionnaire. The man who had been a boy on Day 2 and was now something between a soldier and a survivor, the distinction no longer mattering because the wall didn't care which you were as long as you stood on it.

"What was that?" Edric's voice was level. The shaking that had been constant on Day 2 was gone. In its place was something harder — not confidence, but the absence of the particular kind of fear that wasted energy. He was still afraid. November could see it in the set of his jaw, the way his eyes moved, the grip on his shield that was a fraction too tight. But the fear had been compressed into something functional, forced into the small spaces between discipline and duty, and what remained on the surface was a soldier who responded to explosions by asking questions instead of flinching.

"The west wall." November was guessing. The sound had come from the west, and the vibration pattern — the sequential detonation, the rolling dust — was consistent with the sappers they'd been warned about. The tunnels beneath the Iron Marches that Stoneveil's engineers had been racing to locate. The goblins had been faster.

"The breach?"

"Maybe."

A runner came through the section. Running — not jogging, not the measured stride of a man delivering routine orders, but the full-body sprint of a boy whose message was time-sensitive because the situation it described was time-sensitive and the gap between the two was measured in lives.

"Retreat order! All sections — fall back to the Anvil District! Eastern sections through the gate tunnel! South and west through the Anvil Gate!"

The runner didn't stop. He passed through Section Four and kept going, carrying the words toward the sections further east, the words that meant the outer ring was done and the men standing on it needed to stop standing on it and start moving toward the place where they could stand on something else.

The corporal — Rath, who communicated in gestures and grunts and the occasional syllable he seemed to produce under protest — made a sound that might have been a word. He pointed toward the stairs. The section understood.

They moved.

---

Retreating through a siege was not the same as retreating from one.

November had learned things about war in four days that no training post in an empty yard could have taught him. He had learned that combat was louder than he'd imagined and quieter than he'd feared — louder in the moment, when the noise was physical, a thing that pressed against the skull; quieter in the aftermath, when the silence sat in the ears like water and the world went on muted, the sounds arriving from a distance that was not distance but damage. He had learned that the body was capable of more than the mind believed and less than the situation required. He had learned that fear was not an emotion but a state — a continuous, background condition that coloured everything the way the smoke coloured the sky, so constant that you stopped noticing it until it spiked, and the spikes were the moments when the killing came close enough to touch.

He had not learned how to retreat.

The stairs from the parapet were narrow — single file, the stone steps worn by a century of boots, the walls close enough to brush both shoulders. The composite unit descended in a column: Rath first, then the Legionnaires, then the auxiliaries, then the fragments. November and Edric were near the back. Not by order — by the same gravity that had placed November at the end of every line since Day 2. The back was where the men without rank ended up, and rank was the currency he did not carry.

They emerged into the Iron Marches at street level. The district had been dying for four days — the warehouses gutted by bombardment, the workshops collapsed, the streets cratered and littered with the debris of a place that had been functional six days ago and was now the space between an army and a wall. The air was thick. Smoke from the western collapse mixed with the permanent forge-haze to produce something that was not air but a substance that occupied the space where air should have been, hot and gritty, tasting of ash and the chemical bitterness of goblin ordnance.

Other sections were moving. November could see them in the haze — columns of soldiers flowing south toward the Anvil Gate, the secondary entrance that connected the outer ring to the middle ring. The movement was orderly in the way that military movements were orderly when discipline was the only thing holding them together: precise at the front, where the Legionnaires marched in formation, and fraying at the edges, where the auxiliaries and the wounded and the civilians who had been caught in the outer ring when the gate sealed moved with the ragged, urgent stride of people who knew that what was behind them was worse than what was ahead.

"South," Rath said. The word cost him visibly. He pointed down Foundry Lane — the main avenue that ran from the south wall staging area toward the Anvil Gate, four hundred paces through the district's industrial heart.

They moved. The composite unit fell into the flow of retreating sections, merging with the stream of soldiers and wounded and the few civilians who had been trapped in the outer ring, moving south through the smoke toward the gate that was their exit from a ring that was no longer theirs to hold.

November heard the fighting change.

The sound of combat — the crash, the voices, the percussion of weapons on armour and stone — had been constant since the western breach. But it was moving. Not the static noise of a defended position, the rhythm of assault and repulse that the wall fighting had established over three days. This was mobile. The fighting was in the streets now. The breach had let the orcs through, and the orcs were not stopping at the wall — they were pushing into the district, into the same streets the defenders were retreating through, and the distance between the retreating column and the advancing enemy was a number that was shrinking.

November heard it in the change of the sound's direction. Behind them. Getting closer.

"Faster," Rath said. Another word. His vocabulary was expanding under pressure.

They moved faster. Not running — the wounded among them couldn't run, and the sections ahead were maintaining a pace that prevented the ones behind from sprinting, the column compressed by the street's width and the volume of men trying to pass through it. The pace was a fast walk, the stride of urgency contained by the physical constraints of a narrow avenue and several hundred men trying to use it simultaneously.

The Anvil Gate was ahead. November could see it — or see the shape of it through the smoke, the dark mass of iron and stone that marked the entrance to the middle ring. Soldiers were flowing through it. The sections that had been closer — the eastern wall defenders, the gate garrison — were already inside, already in the Anvil District, already standing on ground that was defensible instead of the ground that was being lost.

Three hundred paces.

Two hundred and fifty.

The sound of fighting was closer now. Not behind them — to the right. The orcs had pushed through side streets, the alleys and cross-lanes that connected the district's blocks, and the fighting that had been at the western breach was now in the intersections, in the spaces between the main avenues, the combat spreading through the Iron Marches like water through cracks.

An intersection ahead. Foundry Lane crossed a narrower street — Anvil Row, one of the side lanes that ran east-west through the district. The sections ahead were passing through the intersection without stopping, the column flowing across the open space with the urgency of men who knew that intersections were where the dying happened.

Rath led them into the crossing.

The orcs came from the right.

---

Not a full assault. A warband — ten, twelve, the count uncertain because they came out of the smoke at a run and the smoke blurred the edges between bodies. Ironclaw warriors, the tooth-and-bone insignia, moving through Anvil Row with the momentum of men who had broken through a wall and were now in the open and were discovering that the open contained more enemies to kill.

They hit the column at the intersection. The sections ahead — already through, already past the crossing — kept moving. The sections behind slowed, compressed, the column bunching at the point of contact the way a rope bunches at a knot.

Rath's section was in the crossing.

The impact was immediate. Two orcs hit the right side of the column — the exposed flank, the side that faced Anvil Row, the side where the retreating soldiers were not expecting contact because contact was supposed to be behind them, not beside them. A Legionnaire went down — struck from the side, his shield facing forward because the threat had been forward, the orc's axe catching him across the ribs where the armour jointed and the gap between the plates admitted the edge.

Rath reacted. The silent corporal became a different man under fire — not louder, but faster, his gestures sharp and precise, his body moving to the threat with the economy of a soldier who had been fighting long enough that combat was not a disruption but a mode. He pulled three Legionnaires into a line facing the intersection, shields up, blocking the mouth of Anvil Row. The formation was textbook. It was also three men against twelve.

"Through!" Rath pointed south. The Anvil Gate. Two hundred paces. The rest of the section — the auxiliaries, the fragments — were to keep moving. The three Legionnaires and Rath would hold the intersection long enough for the column to pass.

November understood the arithmetic. Four men holding an intersection against a warband. Not holding it forever — holding it for the two minutes it would take for the column to clear the crossing and reach the gate. Two minutes of four men absorbing the kind of force that would kill some of them and wound the rest, buying time with their bodies because time was the only currency the retreat accepted.

He started moving south with the others. Edric beside him. The column flowing past the intersection while the sound of Rath's holding action filled the crossing — the crash of shields, the biting sound of blades, the compressed, desperate noise of men trading their lives for minutes.

Then November saw the man on the ground.

---

He was lying on the cobblestones at the edge of the intersection, half in the crossing and half in the gutter that ran along Foundry Lane's western edge. A Legionnaire — the one the orc had hit from the side, the one who'd gone down when the warband struck the column. He was alive. November could see it in the movement — the slow, grinding motion of a man trying to push himself up with arms that were not receiving the correct instructions from his body. His armour was dented at the ribs where the axe had landed. Blood was spreading beneath him — not the bright arterial spray of a killing wound but the dark, steady flow of a deep cut that was leaking faster than the body could compensate.

He was trying to stand.

His hands were flat on the cobblestones, pressing, the muscles in his arms locked in the effort. His legs were not cooperating — one was moving, the knee bending, the foot trying to find purchase on the wet stone. The other was wrong. Bent at an angle that said something inside the leg was no longer connected to the things it was supposed to be connected to, the knee or the hip or the structural architecture that allowed a leg to bear weight. He was pushing with his arms and one leg and the other leg was dragging and he was making a sound — not screaming, not moaning, a low, guttural, animal sound of a body working against itself, the noise of effort applied to a task that effort could not solve.

The column was flowing past him. Soldiers moving south, eyes forward, the retreat's momentum carrying them toward the Anvil Gate with the focused, singular urgency of men who had been told to move and were moving. They stepped around him. Not over — around, the current parting to accommodate the obstruction and closing again behind it, the way a river parts for a stone.

No one stopped.

November stopped.

The compass turned. Not toward the gate — toward the man. The man who was on the ground and who was trying to get up and who was failing because his body was broken and the retreat was moving past him and the orcs were thirty paces behind him and the mathematics of the situation were producing an answer that November's chest rejected before his mind could calculate it.

He knelt beside the Legionnaire.

The man's face was grey. Not the grey of the smoke — the grey of blood loss, the particular, thin colour that skin produced when the heart was pumping fluid that was leaving faster than it arrived. He was older than November. Thirty, maybe thirty-five. A face that had been unremarkable before the siege and was now a mask of pain and confusion and the specific, desperate awareness of a man who understood that he was on the ground and the ground was where the dying happened.

"Can you stand?"

The man's eyes found November. Focused. The effort was visible — the pupils contracting, the gaze steadying, the mind behind the eyes pulling itself out of the place where pain lived and back into the world where questions had answers.

"Leg," the man said. The word was a report, delivered with the compressed efficiency of a soldier trained to communicate his status in the minimum syllables. One word that contained the assessment: the leg was the problem, the leg was not functioning, the leg was the reason he was on the ground instead of in the column.

"I'm going to get you up."

November didn't wait for acknowledgment. He hooked his right arm under the Legionnaire's left shoulder — his good arm, the arm that could still lift, the arm that had been carrying buckets and dragging pallets and swinging a borrowed sword for four days and was being asked to carry one more thing. The man was heavy. Heavier than November. The armour added weight the way armour always did — not just the mass of the iron and leather, but the dead weight of equipment on a body that could no longer support it, the armour becoming a cage instead of protection.

He pulled. The Legionnaire rose — partway, his good leg pushing, his hands gripping November's shoulder, his damaged leg trailing. November staggered. The weight was wrong — too much on the right side, the man's body listing toward the broken leg, the balance constantly shifting toward the side that couldn't hold. His left arm — the arm that had been structural pain since Day 1, the arm wrapped in Edric's cloth, the arm that hung at his side like a pendulum made of fire — screamed as his body tried to compensate, the muscles engaging without permission and producing a flare that whited out his vision for a full second.

He got the man upright. Leaning against him. The Legionnaire's arm over his shoulder, the weight pressing down, the two of them standing in the intersection while the column flowed past and the sound of Rath's holding action cracked and rang behind them.

"November!"

Edric. Five paces ahead. The boy had turned — the only one in the column who had turned, the only one who had noticed that the civilian was no longer beside him, the only one whose attention included the man without armour who carried water and dragged wounded and stood shifts that weren't his.

"He can't walk," November said.

Edric looked at the Legionnaire. At the leg. At the blood. At the intersection behind them where Rath and three men were holding the mouth of Anvil Row against a warband and the holding was making sounds that said the cost was arriving.

"Leave him."

The voice came from behind. Not Edric — a sergeant from the section ahead, turning in the column to look back at the delay, at the civilian holding a Legionnaire who was too heavy and too slow and too broken to be carried through a retreat that was measured in minutes.

"He's slowing the column. Leave him for the stretcher-bearers."

There were no stretcher-bearers. November knew this the way he knew the taste of iron in the water and the weight of the borrowed sword and the sound the sky made when it was wrong — with the certainty of a man who had been inside the siege long enough to understand what was real and what was the lie the system told to make the mathematics bearable. There were no stretcher-bearers because the stretcher-bearers were carrying other men, and the other men were ahead in the column, and the column was moving and anyone not in the column was behind the column, and behind the column was the place where the orcs were.

"Leave him," the sergeant said again. Not cruel. Practical. The voice of a man who had done the arithmetic and arrived at the answer the arithmetic always produced in a siege: the living moved and the dying stayed and the gap between the two was the speed of the retreat.

November adjusted his grip. The Legionnaire's weight shifted. The man groaned — low, involuntary, the sound vibrating through his chest and into November's shoulder.

"No."

One word. The compass word. The word that lived in the same place the Creed lived, in the inner chamber where the promises were kept and the promises were not negotiable, not by sergeants, not by mathematics, not by the sound of orcs thirty paces behind him in an intersection that four men were dying to hold.

*We do not abandon.*

Not a thought. A fact. The way gravity was a fact. The way the weight on his shoulder was a fact. The way the blood spreading from the man's leg was a fact. He did not abandon. The Creed did not have an exception clause for retreats. It did not say *we do not abandon unless the column is moving* or *we do not abandon unless the man is heavier than you* or *we do not abandon unless the arithmetic says otherwise.* It said what it said. What it said was what he was.

The sergeant looked at him. Made the assessment — a civilian, no armour, one working arm, carrying a man who outweighed him and was bleeding and was slowing the retreat by existing. The assessment produced a conclusion. The conclusion was visible in the way the sergeant's face closed, the expression shuttering into the flat, professional blankness of a man who had decided that the civilian was an acceptable loss alongside the man he was carrying.

The sergeant turned and moved south with the column.

"Edric," November said.

The boy was there. Already there — not moving south with the column but moving back, toward November, toward the man who was too heavy and the intersection where the fighting was getting louder. He didn't hesitate. November saw it — the absence of hesitation, the decision that happened in the space between one step and the next, the choice made not with the mind but with the part of him that had decided on Day 2 that the man who grabbed an ankle was worth protecting.

Edric ducked under the Legionnaire's right side. Took the weight. The man's arm over Edric's shoulders, the shield slung on Edric's back, the sword sheathed, both of the boy's hands gripping the Legionnaire's belt and his armour strap, distributing the load the way a blacksmith distributed weight across a frame — efficiently, instinctively, the hands knowing what to do because the hands had been built for this kind of work.

The weight halved.

Not literally — the man still weighed what he weighed, the armour still dragged, the broken leg still trailed and caught on the cobblestones with every step. But the load was shared now, split between November's right side and Edric's left, the two of them forming a frame around the man who could not stand and were carrying him the way the wall carried the siege: together, because together was the only way carrying worked.

"South," November said.

They moved.

---

Two hundred paces to the Anvil Gate. The distance was a number that November's body translated into a cost. Each step was a negotiation — his right leg forward, the Legionnaire's weight shifting, the man's good leg finding the ground and pushing, the broken leg dragging with a sound that was wet and wrong, the scrape of armour on cobblestones marking their pace the way a drum marked a march.

His left arm was the problem. It wasn't useful — hadn't been useful for days, the joint a permanent note of pain that he had learned to carry the way he carried everything, by refusing to set it down. But the weight on his right side — the Legionnaire's arm over his shoulder, the constant, grinding pressure of a man's body pressing downward — was pulling his torso off-centre, and his body's response was to engage the left side for balance, and the left side's response was a cascade of pain that started at the shoulder and ran to his wrist and back and settled into a rhythm that matched his steps, each one a pulse that said the mechanism was being used beyond its specification.

He kept walking.

The column was ahead of them. The gap between November and the last soldiers in the retreat was widening — ten paces, fifteen, the distance growing because the column moved at the pace of healthy men and November moved at the pace of a broken one. The smoke was thicker here, the western collapse still pumping dust and ash into the district, the visibility reduced to thirty paces, the buildings on either side of Foundry Lane appearing and dissolving in the haze like structures that were not certain they existed.

Behind them, the sound of Rath's holding action changed.

November heard it. The crash of shields, the rhythm of the fight — it had been constant, a background percussion that said the intersection was being held and the holding was costing what it cost. The sound changed: not louder, not quieter, but different in the way a sound was different when the thing producing it was no longer the same. Fewer impacts. Fewer voices. The percussion thinning, the rhythm losing instruments the way an orchestra lost them — one at a time, each absence making the remaining sound more exposed, more solitary, until the sound was not a fight but the end of one.

Then the orc war-cry. Behind them. In the intersection they had just left.

Rath's line had broken.

November did not look back. Not because the compass told him not to — the compass was pointing south, pointing at the gate, pointing at the two hundred paces between where he was and where safety was a gate and a wall and the Anvil District on the other side. He didn't look back because looking back would cost a step, and a step was a unit of distance, and distance was the only thing between them and the warriors who had just overrun the intersection.

"Faster," Edric said. His voice was tight. Not afraid — compressed, the way Rath's voice had been compressed, everything unnecessary stripped away until what remained was function. The boy was carrying his share of the weight and moving his share of the steps and his face was set in the expression of a man who was doing arithmetic and did not like the answer.

They moved faster. The Legionnaire groaned. His good leg was failing — the effort of hopping, of pushing, of supporting his own weight on one leg while two strangers carried the rest, was exhausting him. His grip on November's shoulder weakened. The fingers that had been digging into the fabric loosened, and the loosening was the prelude to the letting go, and the letting go was the prelude to the falling, and the falling was the thing November would not allow.

"Stay up." November said it the way Horus had said *fix your sweep* — direct, certain, the voice of someone who was not asking.

The Legionnaire's grip tightened.

One hundred and fifty paces. The Anvil Gate was resolving through the smoke — the dark iron, the stone arch, the narrow passage between the rings. Soldiers were still flowing through it. But the flow was thinning, the column's rear sections entering the gate while the defenders inside prepared to seal it.

Behind them — closer now — the sound of pursuit. Orc boots on cobblestones. The heavy, rapid rhythm of warriors in armour moving at a run, covering the ground that November was crossing at the speed of a wounded man carried by two others. The mathematics were clear. The orcs were faster. The gate was far. The gap between the two was a number that favoured the enemy.

November felt the Legionnaire's weight shift. The man was trying to help — trying to push harder with his good leg, trying to carry some of his own mass, the effort of a soldier who understood the arithmetic as well as November did and was trying to alter it with the only variable he controlled.

"What's your name?" November asked.

The question was absurd. The timing was wrong. The orcs were fifty paces behind them and the gate was a hundred ahead and the smoke was thick and the Legionnaire was bleeding and Edric was straining under the weight and November's left arm was a continuous shriek of protest, and the question was absurd, and he asked it anyway because the man on his shoulder was not a variable. He was a person. He had a name. And the Creed protected people, not variables.

"Brenn." The Legionnaire's voice was a rasp. "Legionnaire Brenn. Second section. Eastern — eastern bastion."

"Brenn. We're going to make the gate."

He didn't know if it was true. The arithmetic said otherwise. But the compass didn't calculate — it pointed, and it was pointing south, and south was the gate, and the gate was where Brenn was going to be because November Falls was carrying him there, and carrying was what November did, and the carrying would continue until the gate was reached or the carrying stopped, and the carrying would not stop because the compass did not have a mechanism for stopping.

Eighty paces. The gate was close enough now to see the details — the iron banding on the doors, the soldiers on the wall above gesturing urgently, the defenders inside the Anvil District watching the retreat's stragglers with the expression of men who were calculating how much longer the gate could stay open.

Behind them: sixty paces. Fifty. The orcs were closing. November could hear individual footfalls now — the distinct, heavy stride of warriors who were not tired because they had just broken through a wall and the adrenaline of the breakthrough was carrying them the way Edric carried the weight, with force and momentum and the certainty that the thing ahead was the thing they had come to take.

Something hit November's back.

Not a blade — a stone, a piece of debris, thrown by an orc at a range where throwing was faster than closing. The impact landed between his shoulder blades and knocked the breath from him and his step faltered and the Legionnaire's weight lurched and for a moment — half a second, less — the three of them tilted, the frame that November and Edric had built around the wounded man threatening to collapse the way a scaffold collapsed when one strut gave.

He caught himself. His left arm seized — the muscles engaging in a spasm that was not voluntary, the body's final attempt to maintain balance using a limb that had nothing left to give. The pain was white. Then red. Then a colour he had no name for, the shade that lived beyond the spectrum of things the body was designed to feel.

He kept walking.

Edric was grunting with each step. The sound was rhythmic, involuntary — the boy's body marking the effort the way a bellows marked the work, the exhale of exertion that said the muscles were at their limit and the limit was being exceeded with every stride. His face was dark with effort. Sweat cut channels through the grime and soot. His hands were white-knuckled on the Legionnaire's belt, the blacksmith's grip doing what it had always done: holding the thing that was heavy and hot and refusing to let go.

Fifty paces.

The gate was open. Soldiers inside were shouting — November could hear the words now, individual voices cutting through the smoke: *move, move, get through, we're closing it, move.* An officer on the wall above was pointing behind them and shouting something that November couldn't make out but didn't need to because the pointing said everything: the orcs were close, the orcs were closing, the gate needed to close and the men outside it needed to be inside before it did.

Forty paces.

Thirty.

November's legs were failing. Not the sudden collapse of a body that gave out but the progressive, incremental failure of muscles that had been asked to perform beyond their capacity for too long — the stride shortening, the steps becoming heavier, the ground pulling at his feet with a gravity that felt personal, targeted, as if the cobblestones themselves had decided that this was where the man with the borrowed sword and the wounded stranger would stop.

He did not stop.

*We are the flame in the night. The wall that does not break.*

Not a thought. Not even words, not in the way that words were things composed of meaning and syntax. It was older than words. It was the thing the words were made from — the raw, grinding, animal refusal to accept that the body's arithmetic was the final answer. The body said stop. The compass said south. The Creed said *we do not abandon.* The Creed was louder.

Twenty paces.

A Legionnaire appeared in the gate. Not retreating — emerging, stepping out from behind the iron doors with his shield up and his spear levelled, facing north, facing the pursuit, facing the orcs who were forty paces behind November and closing. Another soldier beside him. And another. Three men, then five, a small formation that pushed out from the gate like a fist extending from a body, inserting themselves between the stragglers and the pursuit.

Covering fire. Not literal — the soldiers didn't shoot. They advanced ten paces and set their shields and their spears and their bodies between the retreating men and the orcs who were chasing them, and the advance was a statement: *the gate is still ours and the ground in front of it is still ours and you will not take it before we are ready to let you have it.*

November didn't see the soldiers' faces. He didn't see the spears or the shields or the formation. He saw the gate. Ten paces. The dark iron. The stone arch. The passage between the rings that was the difference between being inside and being outside and outside was where the dying happened.

He went through the gate.

The three of them — November, Edric, and the man called Brenn whose blood had soaked through November's sleeve and whose grip on his shoulder had not loosened since he'd been told to stay up — passed through the iron arch and into the Anvil District, and behind them the covering soldiers held for the seconds that covering soldiers held for, and then they pulled back, and the gate began to close, and the sound of iron on stone was the sound of the outer ring becoming something that belonged to someone else.

---

November set Brenn down.

Not gently. There was nothing gentle left in his body — the muscles that would have lowered the man carefully were the same muscles that had carried him two hundred paces through smoke and pursuit and the slow, grim arithmetic of a retreat that the arithmetic said he should not have survived. He set Brenn down the way a man sets down a weight that has been held too long: with relief, with the sudden absence of force, with the shaking that came after the effort stopped and the body was free to tell the mind what the effort had cost.

Brenn was on the cobblestones of the Anvil District. The dark, fire-stained stones of the middle ring — the district that had burned once already, the district that Stoneveil had destroyed and was now defending, the district whose ruins were the next wall.

"Medic!" Edric's voice. The boy was standing — barely, his legs shaking, his chest heaving, the effort of the carry written across his body in sweat and grime and the particular, hollow-eyed expression of a man who had spent everything he had and was discovering what empty felt like from the inside. He was shouting toward the soldiers assembling in the plaza north of the gate, the retreating sections forming up, the organized chaos of a garrison reconfiguring itself on new ground.

A surgeon's assistant came. Not quickly — quickly was a resource the medical staff had spent on Day 2 and not replenished. The assistant knelt beside Brenn with the focused, mechanical competence of someone who had been doing this for four days and had reduced the work to its essential components: assess, stabilize, move. Hands on the leg. A tourniquet from a kit that was lighter than it should have been.

Brenn's hand found November's wrist.

The grip was weak. Not the strong, deliberate grip of Pell on Day 3 — this was the grip of a man whose strength was leaving with his blood, the fingers closing with the last reserves of a body that was prioritizing consciousness over everything else. His face was the grey of bad mornings, of smoke-covered skies, of the colour the world turned when the blood went elsewhere.

"You carried me."

"Yes."

The grip tightened. A fraction. The man's eyes — brown, ordinary, the kind of eyes that belonged in a tavern or a market or a forge, not on the cobblestones of a city that was eating itself ring by ring — focused on November's face with the intensity of a man memorizing the features of someone he would not forget.

"The sergeant said leave."

"Yes."

"You didn't."

November looked at his hands. The right was shaking — the full-body tremor from the carry, the muscles in rebellion, the aftermath of forcing a body to perform beyond its tolerances. The left was worse — the arm had seized completely during the final sprint, the muscles locking in a spasm that ran from his shoulder to his fingers, the joint frozen in a position that was not anatomically intended and was communicating this through a channel of pain so constant it had become a sound, a frequency, a note that played beneath everything.

"No," he said. "I didn't."

Brenn's hand released. His eyes closed. The surgeon's assistant was working — hands, tourniquet, the efficient motions of a system that would determine whether Brenn would fight again or join the column of stretchers that lined the Anvil District's northern wall. November would not learn the answer. The retreat had produced too many Brenns and the system would process them and the processing was someone else's skill.

He stood.

His legs nearly refused. The standing was a negotiation — a conversation between what his body could do and what the compass demanded, the same conversation he'd had on Day 2 and Day 3 and every time the ground had received him and the ground had been told no.

He stood.

Edric was beside him. The boy was looking at him with the expression November had seen on Day 2 in the rubble after the ankle — the expression that said the nineteen-year-old beneath the armour was visible and watching and trying to understand something that could not be understood through training or rank or the language the military used to make the world make sense.

"You carried him," Edric said.

"We carried him."

"You stopped. Everyone else — the column — they walked past him. You stopped."

November looked at the gate. The iron doors were sealed now, the heavy bolts thrown, the wall above manned by soldiers who were watching the outer ring fill with the enemy the way a vessel fills with water — steadily, completely, the space that had been theirs becoming the space that wasn't. Through the gate, if he could see through it, Rath and his three Legionnaires were either dead or behind the orc line, and the distinction no longer mattered because both outcomes produced the same result: men who had bought time with their lives so that other men could carry a stranger to a gate.

"The Creed says we don't abandon," November said. Not as an explanation — as a statement, the way he would state that the sky was wrong or the water tasted of iron. A fact. The compass pointing at the fact. The fact pointing at the man who lived by it.

Edric was quiet for a moment. His hands — the blacksmith's hands, the broad palms, the hammer calluses — were hanging at his sides, and they had stopped shaking.

"I know," he said.

Two words. And in them, November heard the sound of a boy who had decided what he believed, and the decision had the weight of a hammer falling on an anvil, and the ring of it would carry.

---

November checked the compass.

He did it the way he always did — quietly, internally, the inventory that no one saw and no one needed to see. The inner chamber. The question and the honest answer.

*Standing?*

Barely. His body was a ledger of costs: the left arm frozen, the ribs aching from where the stone had hit between his shoulder blades, the legs trembling from the carry, the hands shaking, the blister that had healed into a callus and the callus that had cracked open again during the grip on Brenn's armour. He was standing the way a wall stood after a bombardment — upright, but with cracks.

*Sober?*

Yes. Four days. The bottle was a memory from a different world, a world where the worst thing his hands did was hold a cup.

*The Creed?*

He thought about the man on the cobblestones. The sergeant's voice: *leave him.* The word that had come out of his mouth instead: *no.* The two hundred paces. The stone that hit his back. The gate closing behind them. The grip on his wrist: *you carried me.*

*We do not abandon.*

He had not abandoned.

The cost was written on his body — the arm, the back, the legs, the pain that was not a single note but a chord, every part of him contributing its frequency to the sound the carrying had made. The cost was real. The cost was the price of the Creed, and the price was not theoretical, not the aspirational language of a code hammered together by a man who needed something to hold onto when his hands were shaking. The price was flesh. The price was the distance between a man who left another man on the ground and a man who picked him up, and the distance was measured in blood and pain and the specific, intimate knowledge of what it felt like to carry someone who was heavier than you through a retreat that was trying to kill you both.

He would pay it again.

The compass settled. Not spinning. Not searching. Pointing at the next thing, which was the wall — the new wall, the Anvil District wall, the second ring's defense that was now the first ring's defense because the first ring was gone.

Horus. The name arrived the way it always did — sudden, sharp, the blade finding the gap. She was not in the outer ring. The outer ring was lost. If she had been there — in the rubble, in the collapsed wards, in the spaces he had not been able to search — she was now behind the orc line, and behind the orc line was a place he could not reach, and the not-reaching was a door that he could not open and could not close and the void behind it moved and shifted and was the shape of her.

He closed his eyes. One breath. Two.

He opened them.

The Anvil District spread before him — the burned-out shells of forge-shops and smithies, the blackened walls, the collapsed rooftops, the ruins of the district that Stoneveil had destroyed and was now defending. The smoke was amber here. The light was wrong, the way the light had been wrong since Day 1, filtered through haze that would not clear.

Somewhere in this ruin, the next battle was assembling. The orcs would come. The walls would be tested. The men who had retreated would be asked to stand again, in a district whose bones were ash, in a ring that was smaller and tighter and would compress the siege into the final, grinding equation that produced the number at the end.

November Falls stood in the ruins and checked the weight of the borrowed sword in his right hand. The grip was too tight. The same mistake. The one she had diagnosed from a blister in a morning that felt like it belonged to someone else's life.

He did not adjust.

Edric was beside him. The boy who had come back. Who had not been told to help and had helped anyway. Who had carried his share of the weight because carrying was what you did when the man beside you was carrying and the man on the ground was bleeding and the gate was far and the orcs were close and the arithmetic said leave and the answer was no.

"Next rotation," November said.

Edric nodded. Picked up his shield. Checked the straps.

They walked toward the wall.
