# CHAPTER TEN: THE MATHEMATICS OF BLOOD

## Day 3 — The Grind

---

The sword had not left his hand.

Stoneveil noticed this the way he noticed structural damage — by assessing the condition and filing it. His right hand had been closed around the grip since the second bell, when the first bombardment of the morning had walked across the eastern wall and he had drawn out of reflex and not sheathed because sheathing required a decision and decisions required attention and his attention was allocated. His fingers were cramped. The leather of the grip had worn a groove into the callus between his thumb and forefinger that was not new but was deeper, the skin compressed beyond its usual complaint into something that would blister by evening.

He did not sheathe the sword. Sheathing it would mean the fighting had paused long enough to warrant it, and the fighting had not paused.

Day 3 did not arrive the way Day 2 had — with teeth, with the sudden, percussive violence of an assault designed to overwhelm. Day 3 seeped in. The bombardment that had continued through the night intensified at dawn without the clear delineation of a signal or a war-horn. The catapult rounds came faster. Then the ladders appeared on the eastern wall. Then the ram crews reformed in the Veil's Throat, heavier shields this time, the testudo tighter, the warriors behind the rams learning from the dead who had tried it yesterday.

No war-horn. No charge. Just the steady, grinding pressure of an army that had decided to stop assaulting and start eroding.

"Eastern wall — status."

Veyne was beside him. She had been beside him since before dawn, since before the night bombardment had thinned into the morning bombardment without the intervening silence that Day 2 had afforded. She had not slept either, or if she had, the evidence was invisible — her face held the same flat, tempered expression, the same compressed tension around her eyes. Her slate was open. The stylus moved.

"Holding. Lieutenant Grieve reports three scaling attempts since dawn. Two repulsed. The third—" She paused. Not from hesitation — from the act of selecting the correct word, the way a surgeon selects the correct instrument. "Contained. The Ironborn pushed them off the parapet but the ladder point is establishing a footprint. The orcs are not committing to the breach — they're testing, pulling back, testing again. Different point each time."

"Probing."

"Yes, sir."

Probing. Not the blunt-force geometry of Day 2 — the fist and the fingers, the gate and the flanks. This was different. This was an enemy commander who had counted his dead and arrived at the same conclusion Stoneveil had arrived at: the wall would not fall to a single blow. The wall would fall to a thousand smaller ones, each one inconsequential, each one drawing a handful of defenders to a point that was already abandoned by the time the defenders arrived.

The enemy commander was grinding. The same word. The same strategy. The same mathematics applied from the other side of the wall.

Stoneveil respected this. It made the problem worse.

"Rotation status."

"First and second sections completed their watch at the sixth bell. Third and fourth are on the wall now. The first section has been fed. The second is—" She checked the slate. The stylus paused over a line. "The second section lost three men in the last watch. Legionnaire Hask, Auxiliary Brenner, Auxiliary Tamsin. Hask took an arrow through the visor. The other two were on the eastern parapet when the third scaling attempt breached. The Ironborn pushed it back."

Three more. Three from a number that was already wrong. Stoneveil did the math — not because the math was difficult but because doing it was the discipline, the cold mechanism that kept the names from becoming faces and the faces from becoming the thing he could not afford: grief.

Eight hundred and nine had been the number at the end of Day 2. Yesterday's fighting — the sporadic assaults that continued through the afternoon, the bombardment damage, the two soldiers who had died on the triage pallets overnight — had brought it to seven hundred and ninety-one. Three more brought it to seven hundred and eighty-eight.

Seven hundred and eighty-eight. Sixty-two fewer than two days ago. The wall had lost nearly one man in thirteen, and the siege was not half over, and the supply lines were intact, and the enemy still had depth, and the arithmetic of attrition did not curve — it ran straight, a line drawn from the number he had to the number that meant the wall was empty.

He filed the number. Not beside the forty-three — that was a different ledger, one he maintained separately, in the locked room where the things he did not think about were stored and inventoried with the same precision he applied to everything else. Seven hundred and eighty-eight went into the operational ledger. The one that updated.

"The western flank."

"Quiet. Sergeant Dorran reports no surface activity. The listening posts—" Veyne paused again. The same careful selection. "The listening posts detected vibrations at the third bell. Intermittent. Consistent with excavation."

Stoneveil looked west. From the gate rampart, the western wall curved away into the permanent haze of smoke and forge-dust, the crenellations visible in outline, the guard towers rising at their intervals. The wall looked solid. The wall always looked solid from above. What was happening below the wall — in the old mining tunnels, in the dark passages where the goblin sappers were clearing the collapses that his engineers had created — that was the thing that the wall's appearance could not tell him.

"Depth?"

"Unknown. The listening team estimates thirty to forty feet. The vibrations are irregular — the sappers may be clearing debris rather than advancing."

"Or they've learned to vary their rhythm to mask their progress."

Veyne made no reply. There was none to make. The possibility sat between them the way all tactical possibilities sat — as a weight, a shape in the dark, something that could not be confirmed or denied until the ground opened beneath them and the answer arrived in the form of collapsing stone.

"Double the listening posts on the western section. Six-man teams. Three-hour rotations."

"Sir, that pulls from—"

"I know what it pulls from, Captain."

---

The morning was a siege within the siege.

Three assaults before midday. None of them full commitments — the orc commander was spending warriors the way a man spends coins at a market, testing the price of each section of wall, discovering which parts of the defense were expensive and which were cheap. The eastern wall was expensive — the Ironborn held it, and the Ironborn fought with the specific, implacable efficiency of soldiers who had been in breaches before and who understood that the difference between holding and falling was measured in seconds, not hours, and that the seconds were bought with violence applied at the correct point with the correct force at the correct time.

The gate was expensive. The rune-wards held, dimmer now — the blue-white luminescence that had pulsed bright on Day 1 was a pale flicker, the enchantment spending itself in increments that the rune-smiths tracked on their tallies the way Veyne tracked casualties on her slate. Each ram strike cost the wards a fraction of their stored power. Each bombardment round that hit the bastion face drew another thread from the lattice. The dwarven work was old and deep and had been layered by artisans who understood the craft at levels the human rune-smiths could not reach, and the depth was the only reason the wards were still functional. But depth was finite. Everything stored was eventually spent.

The rune-smiths' assessment: two days. Perhaps three, if the bombardment eased. After that, the Sundered Gate would be iron. Not enchanted iron. Not warded iron. Iron. The material that broke when enough force was applied for long enough, which was the definition of a siege.

Stoneveil filed this.

The western wall was cheap. The probing attacks there were minimal — small groups testing the stakes, the cleared ground, the response times. The orc commander was not interested in the western wall. Not yet. The western wall was the door the goblin sappers were building, and the key was being carved underground, and the silence from below was louder than the fighting above.

Between the assaults, Stoneveil managed the machine.

Rotations. The watch schedule that Veyne had built on Day 1 was disintegrating under the pressure of continuous engagement. Four-hour watches required eight hours of rest between them, and eight hours of rest required that the wall could be held by half the garrison at any time, and holding the wall with half the garrison required that the assaults were predictable, and the assaults were not predictable. The probing — the constant, shifting pressure that the enemy was applying — meant that every section of wall needed more men than the rotation allowed.

Stoneveil adjusted. He shortened the watches to three hours. This gave him an additional rotation cycle, which meant more men on the wall at any given time, which meant the probing attacks met a thicker defense at each point. The cost was rest — three-hour watches with six hours between them, and six hours was not enough. Not for men who had been fighting for two days. Not for bodies that had been beaten and cut and dehydrated and fed salt meat and told to stand on a wall and kill things until they were told to stop.

But the math was the math. The wall needed men. The men needed rest. The two needs were incompatible, and the incompatibility was resolved the way all incompatibilities in a siege were resolved: by spending the resource that was most available, which was the endurance of the men holding the wall.

Repairs. The bombardment had opened cracks in the eastern wall that the engineers could patch but not fix. The patch work was the same compromise that the rune-smiths practiced — a temporary solution applied over a permanent problem, buying hours against a timeline that was measured in days. Stoneveil assigned the engineering crews to the eastern section and told them to prioritize structural integrity over appearance. A wall that looked damaged but held was worth more than a wall that looked sound and collapsed.

Supplies. The arrow count was at fifty-eight per cent. The ballista bolts at forty-seven. The alchemy stores — the oil, the fire pots, the caustic compounds — at forty per cent, and that was with the half-rations he had ordered yesterday. At current expenditure, the alchemy would last one more day. The arrows, two. The bolts, two. After that, the wall would be held by men with swords and shields and the conviction that the alternative was worse.

Stoneveil stood on the rampart and looked at the numbers.

The numbers looked back.

---

The triage decision came at the eleventh bell.

A runner — the boy from this morning, the same boy, Stoneveil could not tell if it was the same boy because they all looked the same now, the runners, the same age and the same pallor and the same too-wide eyes that said they were carrying something they wished they could put down. The boy delivered the message from the triage stations.

Surgeon's assessment: forty-three wounded requiring ongoing care. Twelve critical. Of the twelve, eight could return to the wall with treatment — treatment that would consume the remaining surgical alcohol, the last of the clean bandages, and four hours of surgeon time that was currently allocated to the men coming off the wall with new wounds.

Of the twelve critical, four could not return to the wall regardless of treatment. Their wounds were terminal. The surgeons were spending resources on men who would die, and the resources they were spending could save men who would fight.

Forty-three.

The number arrived and Stoneveil received it the way he received all arrivals from that number — with the flat, controlled acknowledgment of a man who understood that the mathematics of siege did not permit coincidence and did not respect it either. Forty-three in the Anvil. Forty-three in the Throat. Forty-three in the triage station. The universe was not speaking to him. Numbers recurred because populations were finite and the operations performed on them produced similar results, and there was no voice in the arithmetic, no message in the repetition, no ghost of the children he had burned standing behind the number and asking him to notice.

He did not notice.

"Tell the surgeons: treat the eight who can return to the wall. The four terminal cases receive comfort care only. Reallocate the surgical supplies to incoming wounded."

The runner looked at him. The same look that Captain Harren had given him in the Anvil — the expression of a man who has heard a sound he recognizes but hoped never to hear again. But the runner was not Harren. The runner was a boy, and the boy did not have the rank or the years to fill the silence that followed an order like this one with anything except obedience.

"Yes, sir."

"Has the garrison received the morning ration?"

"Sir — the quartermasters report the grain stores are at sixty per cent. Salt meat at fifty. Water is stable — the cisterns are full and the bombardment hasn't hit the pipes."

"Reduce the grain ration by a third. Maintain the salt meat. Soldiers fight on protein, not bread."

The runner left. Stoneveil watched him go — the narrow shoulders, the stride that was trying to be military and was succeeding in the way that young men succeeded at things they practiced: imperfectly, with visible effort, with the particular, earnest determination that was either admirable or heartbreaking depending on whether the man observing it had children.

Stoneveil did not have children.

He turned back to the wall.

---

He ate standing up.

Salt meat. The same ration. The cloth was the same — the folded square from his pocket, reused because waste was a habit and habits were discipline and discipline was the thing holding the man together the way the mortar held the wall together, and both were thinning.

He chewed. The meat was tough. His jaw ached — not from the meat but from the hours of clenching, the sustained, involuntary contraction of a man whose body had been braced for impact since before dawn and whose muscles had forgotten how to release. He could feel it in his teeth, in his temples, in the hinge of his jaw where the tension lived like a creature that had taken residence and was not paying rent.

His hands trembled.

Not the sword hand — the sword hand was steady, the grip locked, the muscles performing the function they had been trained to perform with the mechanical consistency of something that did not require the man's participation. The other hand. The left. The one that held the salt meat, that lifted the water cup, that performed the small, civilian actions of a man who was still, technically, a person who ate and drank and existed in the spaces between orders.

The left hand trembled.

Stoneveil watched it. The fine vibration of the fingers against the water cup — a cup of tin, standard garrison issue, filled from the rampart cistern with water that tasted of iron and the mineral residue of pipes that had been shaken loose by two days of bombardment. The tremor was visible. Not dramatic — not the full-body shake of a man in crisis, not the obvious, uncontrolled trembling that would make the soldiers on the wall glance at their commander and begin the private calculations that men made when they suspected the man giving orders was coming apart.

It was the tremor of exhaustion. Two nights without sleep. Forty-six hours of standing, walking, assessing, deciding, and the physical toll of sustained hypervigilance — the state of a nervous system that had been running at full capacity for so long that the machinery was developing vibrations the way an over-stressed engine developed vibrations, harmonic frequencies that said the system was approaching its tolerances.

He set the cup down. Lifted it again with the same hand. The tremor was still there.

He placed his left hand on the parapet. Pressed. Leaned his weight against it until the stone absorbed the vibration and the hand was still — not steady, but still, the tremor suppressed by the force of contact with something that did not move.

The sword hand was steady. That was what mattered.

He finished the salt meat. Folded the cloth. Pocket.

---

The second assault of the afternoon hit the eastern wall and the gate simultaneously.

By now, Stoneveil could read the pattern. The probing had established the price of each section — the eastern wall cost the orcs three warriors for every defender killed, the gate cost five, the western flank cost nothing because the western flank was not being attacked, and the nothing it cost was an investment in the something it would cost later when the tunnels were finished and the ground opened and five hundred sappers poured through a hole that the wall above could not close.

The assault was harder than the morning's. The ladders came in threes — coordinated, simultaneous, hitting different points along the eastern wall's most vulnerable sections. The patch. The join at the river bluff. The stretch between towers four and five where the wall narrowed and the parapet could only hold two men abreast.

Stoneveil redeployed.

Not himself — he did not leave the gate rampart, because the gate was the linchpin and the linchpin required the commander's presence, and the commander's presence was a resource the same way arrows and oil were resources, and it was spent by being visible in the place where the men needed to see it. He redeployed through Veyne, through the runners, through the system of relayed orders that moved men from where they were resting to where they were needed in the time between the ladder hitting the wall and the first orc reaching the parapet.

The Ironborn held the patch. Lieutenant Grieve — competent, reliable, the kind of officer who performed at the level of his training and whose training was good — held the join. The stretch between towers four and five was held by Legionnaires who had been on the wall for two hours of a three-hour watch and who met the assault with the particular, grinding efficiency of soldiers who were too tired to be afraid and too disciplined to stop.

The fighting lasted ninety minutes.

Stoneveil managed it. Adjusted the rotations as sections tired. Redirected the ballista on tower three to the primary ladder point — the same maneuver he had used on Day 2, the same bolt cutting the same supply line, the efficiency of repetition applied to the mechanics of killing. Ordered the murder holes opened on the gate approach when the ram crews reformed in the Throat, the oil pouring through in the half-ration streams that were thinner than Day 2's cascades but sufficient to turn the corridor into something that flesh could not traverse without cost.

The wall held.

The assault withdrew. Not in retreat — in the same disciplined, shield-faced withdrawal that the orc commander had used all day, the warriors pulling back to the ridge with the controlled pace of men who had done what they were sent to do and would be sent again tomorrow.

Casualty report.

Veyne's stylus moved.

"Eleven dead. Twenty-three wounded. Fourteen returning to duty after treatment."

Eleven. The number joined the day's tally: three from the morning, four from the midday probing, eleven from the afternoon assault. Eighteen dead on Day 3.

Seven hundred and seventy from the starting count. Seven hundred and seventy men and women who could stand on the wall and fight.

Stoneveil did the math. Not the simple subtraction — the projection. At eighteen dead per day, the garrison would reach critical failure in six days. Critical failure was the point where the remaining defenders could not cover the full length of the wall — where gaps appeared, where sections went unmanned, where the enemy could choose a point and commit to it without meeting resistance.

Six days. The siege was on Day 3. Three more days to critical failure. But the projection assumed a constant rate, and the rate was not constant — it was accelerating. Day 2 had cost twenty-seven. Day 3 was costing eighteen, but the fighting was not over, and the night bombardment would add to the count, and the wounded who had been treated today would die tonight or tomorrow, and the men who had been on the wall for three watches in a row would make mistakes in the fourth that they would not have made in the first.

The real number was not six days. The real number was four. Maybe five.

He filed this. The projection went into the same locked chamber as the forty-three, and the seven hundred and seventy, and the word *dispatched*, and the Ironbound Guard who had not been redeployed, and the reinforcements that would arrive three weeks after everyone they were meant to reinforce was dead.

"Supply update."

"Arrows at fifty-one per cent. Bolts at forty-three. Alchemy at thirty-six. The oil reduction is holding but we're drawing from the reserve stocks — the quartermasters estimate two days of oil at half-ration before the reserves are spent."

Two days of oil. After that, the murder holes were architecture — decorative openings in the wall that overlooked a killing ground that could no longer kill.

"The Emberheart?"

"No communication from Lord Commander Blackthorn."

Stoneveil looked at the Inner Ring. From the gate rampart, the Emberheart was visible over the rooftops of the Anvil District — the spires of the Cathedral, the dark spike of the Veilfire Spire with its green-blue flames brighter than yesterday, the high walls of the Inner Ring that enclosed the garrison headquarters and the High Keep and the Lord Commander who sat behind them.

The Ironbound Guard were in there. The best soldiers in Emberfall. Training on the Gauntlet Grounds, drilling with enchanted weapons, maintaining the particular, polished readiness of an elite force that had been preserved for a crisis that was apparently not this one.

Stoneveil did not think about the Ironbound Guard. Thinking about them was the same as thinking about the Anvil — a door he could not afford to open, because behind it was an anger that would not make the wall stronger and would only add weight to a load he was carrying at the margin of what his body and his mind could sustain.

He thought about the wall. The gate. The number.

Seven hundred and seventy.

---

Nightfall came the way nightfall came in sieges — not as darkness but as the dimming of a light that had already been wrong, the amber-grey haze deepening to the colour of smoke and rust and the particular, exhausted brown that Emberfall's sky wore like a bruise it could not heal.

The bombardment eased. Not stopped — never stopped, the catapults maintaining their sporadic rhythm, a round every five minutes, each one a reminder that the silence was not peace but patience, that the enemy was resting and reloading and would be back at dawn with the same grinding, erosive pressure that had characterized the day.

Stoneveil stood on the rampart.

He had not moved. Not in the sense that mattered — he had walked the wall twice, inspected the repair work, spoken to section commanders, given the orders that the orders required. But his place was here, on the gate rampart, where the rune-wards pulsed their fading glow and the Veil's Throat held its dead and the view encompassed the approaches from the ridge to the wall and the wall to the city and the city to the keep where the Lord Commander sat and did not send the men who would change the arithmetic.

He had not slept.

Forty-six hours. Perhaps fifty — the count had become imprecise, which was, itself, a sign of the degradation the hours were producing. His mind was clear. Not sharp — sharpness required rest, required the recalibration that sleep performed on the mechanisms of assessment and decision. His mind was clear the way a blade was clear when the edge had been used too long without honing: functional, still cutting, but with a roughness that the user could feel in the resistance, in the fraction of additional force required to achieve the same result.

He was making decisions. The decisions were correct. The rotations were sound. The supply allocations were optimal. The repair priorities were right. The triage order he had given — the four terminal cases, the reallocation of surgical supplies — was the decision that would produce the maximum number of fighters on the wall tomorrow morning.

Every decision correct.

He stood in the dark on his wall and felt the weight of every decision the way the wall felt the weight of the bombardment — as a cumulative force, each one small, each one manageable, the sum of them a pressure that did not break the structure but changed it, compressed it, made it something denser and harder and less like the thing it had been before the weight was applied.

He had ordered four men to die.

Not in combat. Not on the wall. Not in the clear, clean mathematics of deployment where a man was sent to a position and the position was dangerous and the danger was the cost of the wall holding and the wall holding was the purpose. He had ordered four men — men whose names he had not asked, whose faces he had not seen, whose wounds he had not examined — to receive comfort care instead of treatment because the treatment would have consumed resources that other men needed more, and the four men would die anyway, and the resources spent on them would be resources not spent on men who could return to the wall and fight and bleed and contribute to the seven hundred and seventy that was the number between the city and its end.

Correct decision.

Every triage manual in the Emberfall military confirmed it. Every officer who had survived a siege would confirm it. The doctrine was explicit: when resources are insufficient to treat all casualties, prioritize those with the highest probability of returning to combat effectiveness. The four terminal cases had no probability of returning to combat effectiveness. The eight treatable cases did. The resources allocated to the eight would produce eight additional fighters. The resources allocated to the four would produce four additional corpses.

The math was the math. The decision was the decision. The four men would die because the eight men were worth more to the wall, and the wall was worth more than any individual on it, and Stoneveil was the man who made that calculation because someone had to and because the man who made it was the man who carried it, and carrying it was the job.

He looked at his left hand. The tremor was back. Faint in the dark — a vibration he could feel but not see, the machinery protesting the load.

He pressed the hand against the parapet. The stone held it still.

Veyne approached. Her boots on the rampart, the measured stride, the sound he knew in the dark the way he knew the sound of the wall settling — a familiar pattern that meant the system was still functioning.

"Sir."

"Captain."

"The night watch is posted. Ironborn on the eastern wall and the gate. Legionnaires on the western sections. The listening posts are doubled as ordered — the sappers went quiet at the nineteenth bell. Either they've stopped for the night or they're past the section we can hear."

"Or both."

"Or both."

Stoneveil looked at the western wall. Dark. The guard towers were visible only by the faint glow of the sentries' lanterns, pinpoints of yellow light that marked the intervals like the markers on a sundial — except that the thing being measured was not time but distance, and the distance was the gap between where the wall stood and where the ground beneath it was being hollowed by creatures whose engineering was better than their ethics and whose ability to turn a tunnel into a weapon was a fact that every mining town in the Crimsonmarch had learned at someone else's expense.

"The rune-wards."

"The rune-smiths' evening assessment." Veyne consulted her slate, the stylus catching the faint light. "Ward integrity at sixty-one per cent on the gate. Forty-four per cent on the eastern bastion. The western bastions are holding at seventy-eight — they haven't taken concentrated fire."

"Rate of depletion?"

"At today's bombardment rate, the gate wards fail in two to three days. The eastern bastion wards fail in one."

One day. Tomorrow, or the day after, the eastern bastion's rune-wards would be spent. The stone would remain — the bastion was dwarven-built, solid, three feet of black rock that would not crack under anything short of sustained demolition. But the enchantment that made the stone more than stone, that turned impacts into absorbed energy, that pushed back against the rams and the siege rounds with a force that was not physical — that would be gone. And when it was gone, the stone would be stone, and stone broke.

"When the eastern wards fail, I want the section reinforced. Double the Ironborn. Pull from the western rotation if necessary."

"Sir, if the western tunnels—"

"If the western tunnels break through, we'll know. The listening posts will hear it. The ground will shake. We'll have minutes, not hours, and the deployment at that point becomes a reaction, not a rotation. The eastern bastion is the immediate threat. The tunnels are the next one. We prepare for the immediate and plan for the next."

Veyne wrote. The stylus moved. The ledger updated.

Stoneveil looked at the rune-wards. The blue-white glow was dimmer than it had been at dawn, which had been dimmer than the evening before, which had been dimmer than the morning before that. A progression. A countdown conducted in fading light, each day's end leaving less than the day's beginning, the enchantment spending itself the way the garrison was spending itself — steadily, irreversibly, in service to a wall that demanded everything and returned only the opportunity to stand on it again tomorrow and spend more.

"Captain."

"Sir."

"When did you last eat?"

Veyne looked at him. The question was not in the operational vocabulary — it was not part of the rotation schedule or the supply allocation or the tactical assessment. It was a human question, asked by a commander who had noticed that his most reliable officer had been standing beside him for sixteen hours without taking a meal and that the efficiency he valued was a function that required fuel.

"I'll eat after the watch is posted."

"Eat now. That's an order."

Veyne's mouth did the thing — not a smile, never a smile, but the compression at the corners that was her version of acknowledgement when the acknowledgement contained something she would not say aloud.

"Yes, sir."

She walked to the guard post at the base of the rampart stairs. He heard her speak to someone — the aide, the young officer who maintained the command post's supplies and schedules. The sound of a ration tin opening. The silence of someone eating because they had been told to.

Stoneveil stood on his wall.

Alone.

The wards pulsed. The dark settled. The bombardment continued its slow, patient rhythm — a round every five minutes, each one a concussion that he felt through the stone, through his boots, through the bones of his feet and the joints of his knees and the locked muscles of his back and his shoulders and his neck and the jaw that had not unclenched since before dawn.

Seven hundred and seventy.

Forty per cent alchemy. Fifty-one per cent arrows. Sixty-one per cent ward integrity on the gate. One day on the eastern bastion. Two days of oil. Grain reduced by a third. Four men dying in the triage station because his order said they should die there instead of on the wall, which was the only difference, which was no difference at all.

The math was the math. It had always been the math. At Ashgate, where four hundred and twenty survivors had held a pass for three days and the answer to every question had been a number. At the Crimson Docks, where the raiding galleys came in low and the casualty projections had been a curve he could draw in his sleep. At the Anvil, where the number was nine hundred and twelve and the subset was forty-three and the operation that produced both was an order he had given and watched and not looked away from because that was the rule.

You watch what you order.

The four men in the triage station were dying under comfort care — whatever the surgeons could spare that would reduce the pain without consuming the supplies that the eight treatable men needed. They were dying quietly, he assumed. The way soldiers died when they understood that the system had assessed their value and found it insufficient — not with rage, not with the protest that civilian death permitted itself, but with the flat, exhausted acceptance of men who had been part of a machine long enough to understand that the machine's function was not to preserve its parts but to continue running, and that parts were replaced, and that the parts that could not be replaced were discarded.

He had not asked their names. He would not ask their names. The names would arrive on Veyne's slate tomorrow, in the daily casualty report, listed in the column that tracked the dead without distinguishing between those who died on the wall and those who died because a man on the wall decided they should.

The distinction did not matter to the ledger.

The distinction mattered to the man.

Stoneveil stood on the rampart in the dark. The sword was in his right hand. His left hand was on the parapet, pressed flat against the cold stone, the tremor absorbed by the wall he had been given to hold.

Below him, the Veil's Throat held its dead — the bodies from two days of fighting, orc and human, piled in the narrow corridor where the architecture of killing had done its work. The cleanup crews had not been able to clear them. There were not enough men to spare for the work, and the dead were not a tactical priority, and the bodies in the Throat served a function that Stoneveil had assessed and accepted: they slowed the ram crews. The dead were obstacles. The dead were barriers. The dead were, in the calculus of defense, a resource that did not require feeding.

He had not ordered the dead left in the Throat. He had simply not ordered them removed.

The difference was the same kind of difference as the distinction between the men who died on the wall and the men who died in triage. A line so fine it was invisible. A line he walked every hour of every day of the siege, the line between the decisions he made and the consequences he permitted, between the orders he gave and the outcomes he did not prevent.

The commander's line. The margin. The razor-thin space where a competent man lived — not in the clean territory of righteousness or the clear territory of evil but in the grey, grinding middle, where every decision was correct and every decision cost someone something that could not be returned.

The wind moved through the crenellations. It carried the smell of the siege — smoke, iron, the organic decay of bodies that had been lying in the Throat for two days, the chemical bite of alchemist's fire residue, the underneath smell, the sweet one, the one that Stoneveil recognized and would not name.

He stood on his wall. He had not slept. He had not sheathed his sword. His left hand trembled against the stone and his right hand was steady and the difference between the two was the difference between the man and the machine, and the machine was what the wall needed, and the man was what the machine was consuming, and the consumption would continue until there was nothing left but the function.

Tomorrow the bombardment would resume. The probing attacks would continue. The eastern bastion's wards would weaken further. The sappers would advance underground. The supply counts would drop. The casualty reports would arrive. The numbers would update. The ledger would balance.

And Stoneveil would stand on this wall and do the math.

Because the math was the job. And the job was the wall. And the wall was seven hundred and seventy men and women who trusted the man on the rampart to keep the numbers from reaching zero, and the man on the rampart had not slept in fifty hours and his left hand was shaking and his right hand was locked around a sword he could not let go of and the night was long and the dawn would bring more of the same, and the same was what sieges were: the same, repeated, until the repetition produced an answer.

The wards pulsed. Dimmer.

The dark pressed in.

And the Warden of the Sundered Gate stood on his wall with the mathematics of blood running behind his eyes like a river that would not stop, that could not be dammed, that carried everything he counted and everything he spent and everything he had ordered and watched and not looked away from, and the river ran to an end that was still beyond the horizon but was coming, closer with every bell, closer with every body, closer with every correct decision that killed someone and every number that shrank and every dawn that brought the same and the same and the same until the same became the last.

Seven hundred and seventy.

The number sat behind his ribs.

The wind moved through the ruins.

And the night continued.
