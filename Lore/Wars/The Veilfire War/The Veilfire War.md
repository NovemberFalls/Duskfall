# **The Veilfire War – When the Gods Fell**  
_"They descended as saviors but left as executioners."_  
– Brenna Ironfist, Warden of Karak Zor

The Veilfire War was born from the arrogance of deities and the desperate folly of mortals. It began not with swords but with whispers—gods wagering their faithful against one another, until ambition and treachery sundered the fragile peace. Bloodhollow, a land now known for its shadows and scars, bore witness to the gods' folly.

## **The Wager of Creation**

_"Duskfall was not made to last. It was made to prove a point."_  
– Seeress Lirael Starbrook of Everfall

Duskfall was unlike any world before it. Created in a single divine breath, the realm was not shaped by the slow passage of ages but by the raw will of the gods. The land sprang forth in perfect form—marble cities gleamed beneath star-forged skies, forests stretched like emerald oceans, and mountains rose as monuments to power.

Tyr, Torm, and Helm cast their banners of light across the realm, raising the first bastions of humanity in **Emberfall** and **Sunfield Hold**. Selûne hung the moons and wove the tides, while Corellon sowed the great forests of **Mythrendil**. Moradin hammered the mountains into citadels, where dwarves carved deep beneath **Hammerfall** and **Goldhollow**.

But shadow lurked at the edges of creation. Gruumsh split the land, carving jagged peaks in **Kraggmort**, and Lolth’s webs of deceit stretched through the depths. Bane, ever the patient serpent, did not build—he whispered.

Duskfall was not a paradise. It was a testing ground.

## **The First Betrayal**

_"The moment he smiled, we knew the game was lost."_  
– Aldric Blackthorn, reflecting on Bane’ Bargain

While Tyr and Torm raised temples, Bane offered crowns. Kings, warlords, and desperate commoners struck bargains beneath blood-red moons. **Bloodtide Bay** became a haven for those who traded souls for power, and the goblins of **Zruk’Mar** filled their forges with infernal sparks.

Gruumsh, drawn by the scent of chaos, loosed his warbands from **Scorchridge**. Lolth’s priestesses led exiled elves into the deep, birthing the twisted under-realms beneath **Sylvandor**.

By the time the gods of light saw the rot, it was too late.

Tyr, enraged by Bane’ defilement, broke the ancient pact. **The avatars descended.**

## **The Descent of the Avatars**

_"We thought they had come to save us. We were wrong."_  
– Elara Frostborn, recounting the Fall of Scorchridge

In the ninetieth year of Duskfall, the skies opened. Avatars of divine wrath strode into the mortal realm, luminous and unrelenting.

- **Tyr's Hand of Judgment** descended in flames, wielding the hammer of law.
- **Helm's Silent Vanguard** marched, shields locked as one unbreakable line.
- **Selûne's Silver Blades** slipped through the night, assassins of moonlight and mercy.

Their coming was heralded by victory, but victory demanded sacrifice. Entire cities burned. **Scorchridge** was razed, rebuilt, and razed again. **Mythrendil’s** heartland became a battlefield of ash and enchanted roots.

But not all who descended came to save.

- **Bane' Lords of the Nine** walked in his stead, flames licking at their heels.
- **Gruumsh’s Blood-Eye Warlords** descended, smashing through dwarven holdfasts.
- **Lolth's Shadow-Weavers** opened rifts, unleashing horrors from the Abyss.

For ten years, Duskfall burned.

## **The Scouring of Bloodhollow**

_"There were no victors, only survivors."_  
– Thalion Silvertongue, after the Siege of Emberfall

Bloodhollow became the crucible in which gods were tested.

- **Crimsonmarch** became the bastion of humanity, held by Tyr’s burning gaze. **Emberfall** still bears the scars of celestial fire, its walls reforged from the bones of fallen avatars.
- **Grimhaldir’s** dwarves sealed their gates, hammering at demons who spilled from forgotten chasms. **Hammerfall** remains, but the lower halls of **Karak Zor** lie abandoned, haunted by things that refuse to die.
- **Mythrendil** shrank, its outer woods blackened by Gruumsh’s endless sieges. **Lorianthil** stands defiant, but each year the trees whisper of retreat.

The orcs of **Kraggmort**, fractured by infighting, carried the war to their neighbors. **Bloodtide Bay** became a fortress of raiders, while the forges of **Reaver's Forge** birthed monstrous siege engines under Ashmaw smiths.

In the deepest shadows, the trolls of **Thornshade** waited. When the gods’ fury waned, they struck.

## **The Tenth Year – The Silence**

_"The gods did not leave because they won. They left because there was nothing left to take."_  
– Elara Moonwhisper, Archmage of Sylvandor

On the hundredth year of Duskfall, the avatars flickered. Their forms wavered, and one by one, they crumbled to ash. The gods abandoned the realm, retreating to distant heavens.

No answers were given. Ao, the Overgod, watched and said nothing.

In the wake of divine silence, Bloodhollow stood alone.

## **Aftermath – A Land of Wounds**

_"The Veilfire is gone, but its embers remain."_  
– Brenna Ironfist

Bloodhollow now stands on a blade’s edge.

- **Crimsonmarch** holds the line, but Helm’s watch falters.
- **Mythrendil’s** druids weave desperate spells to halt the encroaching wilds.
- **Grimhaldir**’s forges burn, but the tunnels below hum with ancient nightmares.

The savage races—**orcs, trolls, and goblins**—lick their wounds, but their war horns grow louder.

The Veilfire War has ended.  
**But the gods’ shadow still falls across Bloodhollow.**
