## **The Fall of Gloomwood Hollow - When the Forest Turned**

_"The trees remember who walked their boughs. Now they remember who owns them."_  
— Chieftain Drekka Longtooth

---

### **Date:**

**June 1st - 15th, Year 92 of Duskfall** – During the early months of the Mythrendil Civil War

---

### **Duration:**

Fifteen days of sustained siege and forest warfare

---

### **Location:**

- **Gloomwood Hollow** – Elven outpost city built into the ancient trees
- **The Whispering Paths** – Network of elevated bridges connecting the city's districts
- **The Root Halls** – Underground chambers and fortifications
- **The Green Circle** – Central gathering place and seat of druidic power

---

### **Background:**

Gloomwood Hollow stood as a testament to elven determination to aid their human allies, erected as both fortress and symbol of the alliance between Mythrendil and the Crimson March. Built into the living trees themselves, the city served as a critical defensive position against threats from the northern wilds.

When the Twilight Faction emerged and civil war erupted across Mythrendil, Gloomwood Hollow's garrison was severely depleted as forces were recalled to defend Lorianthil. This weakness drew the attention of **Chieftain Drekka Longtooth** and his troll armies, who had long watched the elven outpost with hungry eyes.

The timing could not have been worse. With the elves' strength divided by internal strife, and the human forces of Emberfall occupied with their own battles, Gloomwood Hollow stood largely alone against the coming storm.

### **The Battle – Phase by Phase Breakdown:**

---

**Days 1-3 – The Forest's Turn**  
_"The trees whispered warnings, but we didn't understand until they started screaming."_  
— Grove Guard Survivor

Drekka's shamans began their work before the first warrior stepped foot in elven territory. Through dark rituals and primal magic, they began turning the forest itself against its protectors. Trees that had sheltered elven scouts for centuries now reached down with grasping branches to ensnare them.

Rootweaver Elowen led desperate counter-rituals, trying to maintain the bond between elves and forest. But with each passing hour, more of the woods fell under troll influence. By the third day, entire sections of the canopy network had to be abandoned.

---

**Days 4-7 – The Siege Begins**  
_"They didn't need to climb the trees. They simply broke them."_  
— High Commander Aelindra Starweaver

With the forest partially turned, Drekka launched his main assault. Troll warriors attacked in waves, using their tremendous strength to literally tear down sections of the living city. **Warchanter Groth Bonevoice** led war chants that drove both trolls and beasts into terrible frenzies.

The Grove Guard fought desperately, using their superior mobility in the canopy to strike and fade. But each lost position meant another section of the city exposed to troll brutality. The Deepwardens attempted to collapse tunnels beneath advancing trolls, but **Bonegrinder Vashrak** had anticipated this, using beast packs to clear the underground paths first.

---

**Days 8-11 – The Roots Burn**  
_"We thought the roots would save us. They became our tomb."_  
— Deepwarden Commander

As surface fighting intensified, many civilians and wounded retreated to the Root Halls. But troll shamans had been corrupting these spaces for days. Ancient wards failed, and protective enchantments turned hostile. **Entire chambers collapsed**, crushing those who had sought shelter there.

High Commander Aelindra realized the city was lost when reports came of similar corruption spreading in Mythrendil's other territories. With the civil war straining their forces, there would be no reinforcements.

---

**Days 12-15 – The Withdrawal**  
_"Better to retreat with honor than die without purpose."_  
— High Commander Aelindra Starweaver

Aelindra ordered a fighting withdrawal, using what remained of their druidic magic to cover the retreat. The Grove Guard fought rearguard actions, buying time for civilians to escape through hidden paths known only to the eldest elves.

Rootweaver Elowen led the last ritual in the Green Circle, unleashing wild magic that would make the city uninhabitable to any who claimed it. The spell succeeded, but at great cost - the corruption twisted it, turning Gloomwood Hollow into a place of permanent shadow and malice.

Drekka claimed the hollow city, but found it changed by Elowen's final spell. The trolls adapted, becoming the Shadowclad, using the perpetual gloom to their advantage. They have held the city ever since, no force yet able to breach its twisted defenses.

The Fall of Gloomwood Hollow marked a crucial turning point in both the Mythrendil Civil War and the broader conflict of the region. Its loss severely compromised elven-human military cooperation and created a powerful new threat in the form of the Shadowclad Trolls. The city stands to this day as a dark monument to the price of divided strength and the consequences of desperate magic.
