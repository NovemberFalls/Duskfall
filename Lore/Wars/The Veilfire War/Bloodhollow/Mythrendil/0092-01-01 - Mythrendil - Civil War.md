## **The Great Sundering - Mythrendil's Civil War**

_"When shadow claimed half our kin, we learned that betrayal cuts deeper than any blade."_  
— High Commander Aelindra Starweaver

### **Date:**
**Year 92 of Duskfall** – Third year of the Veilfire War

---

### **Background:**

The civil war erupted in the third year of the Veilfire War, when approximately half of the elven population fell under the influence of evil gods. This devastating conflict created the **Twilight Faction**, a force that turned brother against brother, using identical equipment and training as their Green Guard counterparts.

The war proved catastrophic for the elven people, with 70% of their total population killed in the resulting conflict. This internal strife left Mythrendil vulnerable on multiple fronts, forcing them to fight a three-front war against:
- The Twilight Faction (internal)
- Trolls (external)
- Veilfire War forces (external)

### **Key Factions:**

#### **The Green Guard (Loyalist Forces):**
- **Leaders:**
    - _High Commander Aelindra Starweaver_
