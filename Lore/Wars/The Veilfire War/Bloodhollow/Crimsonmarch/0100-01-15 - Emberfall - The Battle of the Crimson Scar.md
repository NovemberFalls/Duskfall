## **The Battle of the Crimson Scar – When the Plains Burned**

_"Blood sinks fast into the plains, but the scars left behind never fade."_  
— Captain Isolde Veyne

---

### **Date:**

**Year 100 of Duskfall** – Four months after the Blackroot Siege

---

### **Duration:**

Three days and three nights

---

### **Location:**

- **The Crimson Scar** – A swath of burned plains stretching east of **Sunfield Hold** toward **Stonehaven.**
- **Sunfield Plains** – A vital trade and reinforcement route connecting Emberfall’s eastern settlements.

---

### **Background:**

Following the devastation of the **[[0099-09-01 - Emberfall - The Blackroot Siege]]**, the remaining forces of **Warlord Thokk Ironhide** fled east across the **Sunfield Plains.** There, they scattered into warbands, led by **Krogan Bloodtusk,** one of Thokk’s most brutal lieutenants.

Krogan sought to cut off Emberfall’s eastern supply lines by targeting caravans and patrols along the plains, aiming to destabilize defenses between **Sunfield Hold** and **Stonehaven.**

In response, **Lord Commander Aldric Blackthorn** deployed **Captain Isolde Veyne** of the **Ironbound Guard** alongside dwarven artillery from Grimhaldir, led by **Warden Garril Keggrin.** Their orders were to intercept the warbands and halt Krogan’s campaign before it reached the mining town of Stonehaven.

### **The Battle – Day by Day Breakdown:**

---

**Day 1 – Flames on the Horizon**  
_"Hold the line, or the fire will burn all the way to Stonehaven."_  
— Captain Isolde Veyne

Krogan’s warbands emerged from the eastern horizon, cutting a swath through supply caravans heading to Stonehaven. Veyne’s forces intercepted them at the outskirts of the **Sunfield Plains.**

Goblins attempted to breach defensive lines by tossing crude Veilfire explosives into the trenches. Dwarven artillery retaliated, **igniting the plains** and creating a burning perimeter that held back the initial assault.

---

**Day 2 – The Red Sky**  
_"Fire is both sword and shield. If the plains burn, so shall they."_  
— Warden Garril Keggrin

The Ironclaw remnants regrouped overnight, attacking at dawn behind a shield of smoke. Goblin sappers detonated portions of the outer trenches, breaking through sections of the defensive line.

**Captain Veyne led a counterattack with 200 soldiers,** engaging orc warbands directly in brutal melee combat. The skies burned red as Veilfire spread, but the defenders reclaimed ground by midday.

---

**Day 3 – Krogan’s Last Stand**  
_"Your beast bleeds, Krogan. It bleeds as you do."_  
— Captain Isolde Veyne

Krogan Bloodtusk personally led the final assault, riding atop a massive war beast wrapped in molten iron plates. The creature shattered the outer trenches, forcing the defenders into tight formation.

**Captain Veyne intercepted Krogan in single combat,** clashing atop burning Veilfire ditches. After a brutal duel, **Veyne severed Krogan’s spine,** casting his body into the flames. The remaining orcs, leaderless, scattered across the plains.

---

### **Aftermath and Legacy:**

- **Survivors:** _470 defenders emerged from the battlefield._
- **The Crimson Scar** remains a cursed land, where nothing grows, and the Veilfire smolders beneath the soil.
- **Captain Isolde Veyne** earned the title **"The Bastion’s Talon"** for her decisive leadership and courage.
- **The Red Reaper’s Axe** was taken to Emberfall’s **Vault of Ash** for safekeeping.
