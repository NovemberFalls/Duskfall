### **The Black Anvil Revolt – Emberfall’s Iron Fracture**

_"When a forge breaks, you don’t hammer it back into shape. You melt it down and start over."_  
— Warden Alric Stoneveil

---

### **Date:**

**Year 99 of Duskfall** – In the final year of the Veilfire War, just six months before the Blackroot Siege.

---

### **Duration:**

Three days of brutal urban combat.

---

### **Location:**

- **Smelter’s Row (Emberfall’s Industrial Ring)**
- **Forge Road (Production Heart of the Anvil District)**
- **The Black Anvil (Rebel Stronghold, Former Grand Forge)**

---

### **Background:**

While most of Emberfall’s attention was directed outward toward the crumbling front lines of the Veilfire War, discontent grew within its heart. Years of conscription, harsh taxation, and dwindling resources had stretched the industrial caste of Emberfall to a breaking point. **Dwarven forgemasters, human smiths, and laborers of Smelter’s Row bore the weight of the war—often literally—without reprieve.**

At the center of this discontent was **Forge-King Drelgar Blackhand**, a dwarf who rose to prominence within the **Anvil District**. Blackhand, once loyal to Emberfall’s Council of War, grew increasingly bitter as he watched **his people driven to exhaustion and their forges stripped bare to feed the war machine.**

In the final months of the war, Blackhand declared the forges under his control sovereign, seizing shipments of steel and arming the smiths and laborers. The rebellion erupted in full force, with the **Black Anvil Forge** becoming both a symbol of defiance and the rebel stronghold.

---

### **Forces Involved:**

#### **Crimsonmarch Loyalists (Human & Dwarven Alliance):**

- **Commanders:**
    - _Warden Alric Stoneveil – Commander of Emberfall’s Inner Guard_
- **Forces:**
    - **850 Soldiers – Emberfall Legionnaires and Ironborn**
    - **300 Militia – Pressed from merchants and mercenaries loyal to the Council of War.**
- **Tactics:**
    - **Strategic Incineration** – Warden Stoneveil authorized firebombing of rebel-held districts to drive out insurgents.
    - **Tunnel Assaults** – Dwarven loyalists used Smelter’s Row’s underground tunnels to infiltrate and sabotage rebel forges.
    - **Brutal Retaliation** – Any forge suspected of aiding the rebels was dismantled, its masters exiled or executed.

---

#### **Black Anvil Rebels (Industrial Workers and Militant Smiths):**

- **Leaders:**
    - _Forge-King Drelgar Blackhand – Rebel Leader_
- **Forces:**
    - **1,100 Rebel Smiths and Laborers** – Armed with repurposed tools and siege weapons.
    - **150 Artificers** – Specialized in crafting improvised Veilfire bombs.
- **Tactics:**
    - **Weaponized Forgefires** – Blackhand’s rebels turned industrial forges into flame-spewing artillery, creating **walls of molten slag** to block loyalist advances.
    - **Relic-Wielding Insurgents** – Rebels wielded **enchanted tools**, some cursed relics that imbued temporary power but degraded the mind.
    - **Smelter’s Traps** – Entire sections of Smelter’s Row were rigged with collapsible furnaces, designed to bury advancing soldiers in molten iron.

---

### **The Revolt – Day by Day Breakdown:**

---

**Day 1 – The Anvil Ignites**  
_"They didn’t ask for freedom. They demanded it—with hammer and flame."_  
— Survivor of Smelter’s Row

At dawn, Drelgar Blackhand and his forces barricaded **Forge Road**, claiming the forges within **Smelter’s Row** as sovereign ground. **Artificers ignited massive forgefires**, driving out loyalist forces stationed within the district.

By nightfall, large sections of the Anvil District burned, while Blackhand’s forces **cut off steel shipments to the Emberheart**. In retaliation, **Warden Stoneveil issued an order to seal Smelter’s Row**, trapping the rebels inside.

---

**Day 2 – Fire and Steel**  
_"We burned the forges to save the city. But some fires can’t be extinguished."_  
— Warden Alric Stoneveil

Stoneveil’s forces attempted to breach the **Black Anvil Forge**, but were repelled by molten slag walls and weaponized steam traps. Dwarven saboteurs infiltrated the tunnels beneath the district, but half of their ranks were consumed by the collapsing furnaces rigged by the rebels.

By midnight, **half of Forge Road lay in ruin**, and Stoneveil authorized incendiary bombardments from the **Iron Marches**. **Loyalist soldiers razed portions of Smelter’s Row**, leading to significant civilian casualties.

---

**Day 3 – The Fall of the Anvil**  
_"Drelgar didn’t die kneeling. He died standing over his forge."_

As the fires spread beyond the Anvil District, **Stoneveil led the final assault personally, breaching the gates of the Black Anvil.** Drelgar Blackhand, refusing surrender, stood at the heart of his forge as the structure collapsed around him. His surviving rebels scattered, and the fires were extinguished by nightfall.

---

### **Aftermath and Legacy:**

- **Survivors:** _200 rebels escaped through hidden tunnels, though many were hunted in the following months._
- **Warden’s Command:** _Stoneveil was granted expanded authority over the Anvil District, cementing his position as **Warden of the Sundered Gate**._
- **The Scar of Smelter’s Row:** _Entire portions of the industrial ring remain uninhabited, known as **The Ashscar**, a silent reminder of the revolt._
- **The Black Anvil Auction House:** _The ruins of the Black Anvil Forge were repurposed into an auction house, selling weapons crafted from the ashes of the rebellion._
- **Legends of Blackhand:** _Some believe Drelgar’s molten spirit still lingers beneath Emberfall’s streets, his hammer waiting for the day when the forges will rise in rebellion once more._
