## **Siege of Stonehaven – The Mines that Bled Fire**

_"The Wyrmtooh devours the weak, but we fed it iron and blood until it choked."_  
— General Darius Crownhold

---

### **Date:**

**April 17th – April 24th, Year 92 of Duskfall**

---

### **Duration:**

Eight days and nights

---

### **Location:**

- **Stonehaven** – Easternmost mining town, base of the **Wyrmtooh Range**.
- **Iron Vein Mines** – Labyrinthine tunnels beneath Stonehaven, rich with **Veilfire crystal deposits**.
- **Blackhammer Pass** – Fortified trade route winding through the Wyrmtooh Range, connecting Stonehaven to Sunfield Hold and Emberfall.

---

### **Background:**

Stonehaven is Emberfall’s iron lung. Built into the jagged base of the **Wyrmtooh Range**, its mines fuel the kingdom’s forges, and the rare Veilfire crystals unearthed there are used to power enchanted war machines. Without Stonehaven, Emberfall’s war efforts would wither.

The third year of the Veilfire War brought ruin to its doorstep. From the broken crags of Wyrmtooh descended **Warcaller Grizk Spineburn,** a goblin commander notorious for his sadistic tactics and Veilfire-laced destruction. His forces—**a brutal coalition of goblin sappers and Kraggmort orcs**—sought to claim Stonehaven’s mines and sever Emberfall’s eastern lifeline.

**Lord Commander Aldric Blackthorn** ordered **General Darius Crownhold** east with a contingent of Ironborn and **400 Stoneguard dwarves** under the banner of **Grimgar Hollowfist**. Alongside them rode **Captain Jorran Greythorn** and **Merik “Coinmaster” Vail,** a tiefling smuggler tasked with preserving supply lines through less conventional means.

---

### **The Siege – Day by Day Breakdown:**

---

**Day 1 – Collapse of Blackhammer Gate**  
_"Warcaller Grizk’s voice rang out, and the Wyrmtooh screamed with him."_

Goblins detonated Veilfire beneath Blackhammer’s outer gates at sunrise. **Two watchtowers crumbled,** burying dozens beneath stone. **Captain Greythorn** led a shield wall to plug the breach as **Grimgar’s dwarven cannons** rained molten iron from the ridge.

---

**Day 3 – Veilfire Beneath Stonehaven**  
_"Flames do not stop at your doorstep—they crawl beneath it."_

Grizk’s sappers tunneled beneath Stonehaven’s lower quarter. **Veilfire detonations** ignited the residential ward, forcing hundreds to retreat into the mines. **Greythorn led a countercharge** but was wounded when an orc berserker shattered his left pauldron.

---

**Day 5 – The Hollowing of Villages**  
_"The villages were fuel. I regret that I left them to burn—but Stonehaven did not."  
— Merik "Coinmaster" Vail_

To sustain Stonehaven, **Merik Vail diverted supplies from surrounding villages.** **Wyrm’s Hollow and Greystone** were left defenseless, razed by marauding orcs. While Vail ensured Stonehaven endured, his reputation soured in the east.

---

**Day 8 – Grizk’s Death at the Mines**  
_"I dragged him out by the throat. He thought fire could save him from iron."_  
— Grimgar Hollowfist

Grizk led a final push into the lower mines, but was **pulled from his warhorn chariot by Grimgar Hollowfist.** The goblin died screaming, his body broken atop the molten gates of the Iron Vein Mines. His army fractured and fled, leaving Stonehaven scorched but standing.

---

### **Aftermath and Legacy:**

- **Survivors:** _620 defenders emerged._
- **Grimgar’s Rise:** _Elevated to Warden of the Eastern Ridges._
- **Crownhold’s Legacy:** _His refusal to abandon Stonehaven solidified his place as Emberfall’s Iron Bull._
- **The Scarred Veins:** _Veilfire still smolders in sections of the mines._
