### **Emberfall - The Blackroot Siege

_"Stone may crumble, but Emberfall bleeds in silence."_  
— Warden Alric Stoneveil

---

### **Date:**

**Year 99 of Duskfall** – One year before the extinguishing of the Veilfire War

---

### **Duration:**

Six days and six nights.

None slept. None wept.

---

### **Location:**

- **The Veil’s Throat (The Killbox beyond the Outer Walls)**
- **The Sundered Gate (Outer Ring of Emberfall)**
- **The Iron Marches (The Fields Within the Wall)**
- **The Black Bastion (Heart of the Ironborn Legion)**

---

### **Background:**

The **Blackroot Siege** wasn’t war.

It was a prolonged funeral, the mourners standing upright with blades in hand.

Six days the siege lasted, where Emberfall’s people, their iron-hearted militia and dwarven allies, stood beneath the hammer of the Ironclaw orcs and the infernal flames of Pyrelord Skrixx Blazebinder. **Veilfire**—once the shield of the city—spluttered and waned, cracks forming as darkness crept into the sky.

It was not merely victory the enemy sought. **Warlord Thokk Ironhide** wished to split the city's bones, while Skrixx longed to see her aflame until the **Emberheart** wept molten tears.

The defenders knew there would be no surrender. Only an ending written in either steel or ash.

---

### **Forces Involved:**

#### **Crimsonmarch Defenders (Human & Dwarven Alliance):**

- **Commanders:**
    
    - _Warden Alric Stoneveil – "The Silent Bastion" (Sundered Gate)_
    - _General Darius Crownhold – "The Iron Bull" (Black Bastion Commander)_
- **Forces:**
    
    - **850 Souls, fading one by one.**
    - **600 Human Soldiers – Ironborn Militia** – Those not fit to hold a sword held the gates with their blood.
    - **250 Dwarven Stoneguard – Grimhaldir's Shield.**
- **Tactics:**
    
    - **Runed earthworks**—the last whispered remnants of ancient dwarven magic.
    - **Chokepoints drowned in oil** and lined with flame, so even retreat burned their heels.
    - **Artillery managed by Garril Keggrin,** whose cannons wept molten iron over enemy ranks.

---

#### **Enemy Host (Kraggmort and Zruk’Mar Forces):**

- **Leaders:**
    
    - _Warlord Thokk Ironhide – "The Iron Wall" (Supreme Leader of the Ironclaw)_
    - _Pyrelord Skrixx Blazebinder – "Flame that Walks" (Ashen Warrens Firebrand)_
- **Forces:**
    
    - **2,500** – The number was meaningless. The dead marched twice over.
    - **1,200 Orc Warbands – Warcrushers of Ironclaw.**
    - **800 Goblin Sappers – Bombers armed with veins of fire.**
    - **500 Revenants – Bane's Kissed.**
- **Tactics:**
    
    - **Veilfire Crystals** – Explosives that could turn stone to molten ruin.
    - **Undermining teams** – Burrowing beneath walls to gut the city from below.
    - **Necromantic Corpses** – They came again each night, a slow tide of silent death.

### **The Siege – Day by Day Breakdown:**

---

**Day 1 – When the Earth Split**  
_"Keggrin’s cannons roared like dragons, but dragons grow tired."_  
— Warden Alric Stoneveil

Thokk’s forces hit the Veil’s Throat at sunrise. **Ironclaw berserkers** broke against the trenches like waves on jagged rocks, but the goblins weren't there to fight.

They came to **burn**.

Keggrin rained fire from the battlements, but Skrixx's sappers tunneled beneath, planting **Veilfire bombs** beneath the ridges. By dusk, the outer walls cracked like ribs beneath an orc's fist.

Stoneveil ordered the ridges collapsed. He buried fifty of his own.

---

**Day 2 to 4 – The Long Night**  
_"Flame crept beneath our feet and our skin peeled with it."_

The goblins' work was slow. By the second day, tunnels reached the heart of the Marches. The ground shifted unnaturally—black veins of Veilfire spreading beneath the surface.

By the third night, **undead rose**, slipping through the cracks, whispering dark promises. **Crownhold broke them himself,** each night taking an axe to revenants that crawled from the soil.

On the fourth day, Keggrin's artillery screamed itself silent. His guns had grown too hot.

---

**Day 5 – When the Gate Gave**  
_"Thokk’s hammer wasn’t what broke the gate. We did."_

At dawn, Thokk led the charge into the **Iron Marches**. Emberfall’s outer walls finally split beneath the weight of orcish steel.

Stoneveil held the gate with 300 men.

He left with 40.

Crownhold collapsed the trenches behind him, sealing them in with fire.

---

**Day 6 – Death’s Gambit**  
_"Thokk bled in the end. They all bleed."_  
— Warden Alric Stoneveil

Thokk breached the Black Bastion just before sunrise. Skrixx’s flames roared along the east wall, but Stoneveil met him there.

They say Warlord Thokk died on the seventh strike of Stoneveil’s sword. **Stoneveil did not deny it, nor did he confirm it.**

Skrixx fled. Emberfall did not.

---

### **Aftermath and Legacy:**

- **Survivors:** _72 men and women stood when the sun rose._
- **Stoneveil's Title:** _Warden Alric Stoneveil became known as the **Silent Bastion**._
- **Crownhold's Vigil:** _General Crownhold built the walls anew, one stone for each man lost._
- **The Crimson Scar:** _A stretch of earth where nothing grows, kissed by Bane' hand._
