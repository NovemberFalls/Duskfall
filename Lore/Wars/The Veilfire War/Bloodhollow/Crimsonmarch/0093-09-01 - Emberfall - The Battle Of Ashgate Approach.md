## **The Battle of Ashgate Approach**

_"The road to Emberfall is paved with the bones of those who thought it theirs to take."_  
— General Darius Crownhold

---

### **Date:**

**Year 93 of Duskfall** – Midpoint of the Veilfire War

---

### **Duration:**

Three days of sustained conflict, culminating in a decisive night assault.

---

### **Location:**

- **Ashgate Approach** – A narrow stretch of fortified road leading into the outer territories of Emberfall.
- **Stoneveil Rise** – The elevated ridge from which the defenders repelled the final orcish advance.
- **Crimson Fields** – The stretch of open land between the fortifications and the enemy encampment, now known as the _Red Reach_ for the blood spilled there.

---

### **Background:**

The **Battle of Ashgate Approach** marked one of the first major incursions into Emberfall’s heartlands during the Veilfire War. **Warlord Thokk Ironhide**, in the early years of his rise, led a brutal campaign to sever Emberfall’s supply lines from Sunfield Hold. The Ashgate, a critical pass, controlled vital trade and reinforcement routes between Emberfall and its eastern provinces.

Without it, the city's outer defenses would crumble from within, allowing the Ironclaw Orcs to encroach deeper into human and dwarven territories.

**General Darius Crownhold**, recently appointed commander of Emberfall's outer defenses, led the defense. At his side was **Captain Alric Stoneveil**, then a junior officer yet to earn his fabled title. Together, they commanded a combined force of **human legionnaires and dwarven artillery** from Grimhaldir.

### **The Battle – Day by Day Breakdown:**

---

**Day 1 – The Charge into Ashgate**  
*"Let them come. The ground here is older than their bones, and the stone will remember them when they break."_  
— Captain Alric Stoneveil

The Ironclaw horde surged from the tree line at dawn, aiming to seize Ashgate in a single push. The **Ironborn militia**, entrenched along the pass, met them with shields locked and archers raining volleys from the ridge above.

By mid-afternoon, the orcs forced the defenders to retreat toward the inner trenches. **Garril Keggrin's dwarven artillery** unleashed molten Veilfire shells, creating firestorms that halted the orcs' momentum.

---

**Day 2 – The Sapping of Stoneveil Rise**  
_"Fire may break the sword, but the hand will hold fast."_

Under cover of night, **goblin sappers** burrowed beneath Stoneveil Rise, collapsing part of the ridgeline in an attempt to disable the artillery. Crownhold anticipated the move, and **Lieutenant Varra Halefrost** led a detachment to collapse the tunnels from within, burying the sappers alive.

By day’s end, the **Ironclaw orcs regrouped**, sending their war beasts forward, breaching the outer trenches. Crownhold ordered a fallback to the final ridge, setting traps along the remaining pass.

---

**Day 3 – The Bloody Approach**  
_"I did not hold the line alone. It held me."_  
— Captain Alric Stoneveil

At dawn, **Warlord Thokk Ironhide** led his personal warband forward, wielding his infamous warhammer, _Cragbreaker_. The **Crimson Fields** became a charnel ground as orcish infantry smashed against Emberfall's militia.

Though wounded, Thokk pressed the assault until **Overseer Brok Drakhold**, one of his siege commanders, fell to Captain Alric Stoneveil in single combat beneath the shattered outer gate. **Stoneveil's halberd**—a brutal extension of dwarven craftsmanship—pierced Drakhold’s chestplate, ending the orc’s advance.

With their overseer dead, Thokk ordered a retreat before the full might of Emberfall’s artillery could trap his forces in the bottleneck. **General Crownhold’s cannons rained molten slag behind them**, burning through the retreating orcish rear guard.

The Ashgate was held—but at great cost.

---

### **Aftermath and Legacy:**

- **Survivors:** _420 defenders out of 1,100._
- **Captain Alric Stoneveil** earned the title _"The Unyielding Shield"_ after the battle, marking his rise through Emberfall’s ranks.
- **The Red Reach** became a cursed field, marked by remnants of Veilfire that still burn in patches to this day.
- **General Crownhold** reinforced the Ashgate with **dwarven stone and Emberfall’s steel**, preventing future incursions along that route.
