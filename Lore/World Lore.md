**The Veilfire War – A World Born in Ash**  
_"Duskfall was not built for peace. It was built to test the limits of suffering."_  
– Aldric Blackthorn, Lord Commander of Emberfall

Duskfall is young—only a century old. Born not through the slow march of time but by divine will, it was created as a proving ground for the gods, a realm forged to settle the eternal question of whose influence was strongest.

For ninety years, mortals grew beneath the quiet gaze of their makers, until the gods' pride sparked the Veilfire War. Bane and the dark pantheon twisted the wager, unleashing demons and corruption upon the land. The gods of light answered, and their avatars fell to Duskfall like blazing meteors.

For ten years, the land burned. When the war ended, the gods—victorious in nothing—abandoned their creation. The avatars disappeared, leaving Duskfall scarred and silent.

**Bloodhollow – The Dying Continent**  
_"We are alone in the dark, and the dark is watching."_  
– Aelindra Starweaver, High Commander of Lorianthil

Bloodhollow lies in the northwest of Duskfall—a continent of fading light. The last bastions of civilization stand fragile and flickering:

- **Crimsonmarch** – The human empire, still defiant but stretched thin.
- **Mythrendil** – The elven forest-realm, isolated and shrinking.
- **Grimhaldir** – The dwarven under-kingdom, whose gates are sealed, silent since the war.

The rest of Bloodhollow belongs to the savage races—**orcs**, **trolls**, and **goblins**—fractured but growing in strength.

The orcs of **Kraggmort** rule the mountains and coast, the goblins of **Zruk’Mar** blacken the plains with smoke and rust, and the trolls of **Thornshade** stalk the forests and frozen wilds. For now, they fight among themselves. But each day, their warbands draw closer.

**A Precipice of War**  
_"The gods gave us this world to break. Now we hold the pieces."_  
– Elara Frostborn, Warden of Frostwind Keep

The gods are gone. The heavens are silent. The alliances of men, elves, and dwarves strain under the weight of their own survival.

Bloodhollow stands alone—one breath away from collapse.

_The war ended._  
_The embers remain._  
**And the fire is spreading.**
