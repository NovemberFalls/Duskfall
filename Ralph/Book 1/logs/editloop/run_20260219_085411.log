=== Iteration 1 ===
**Prologue — THE ANVIL: Edit complete.**

- **Before:** ~3,600 words
- **After:** 1,881 words (48% cut)
- **Committed:** `edit: Prologue — THE ANVIL — prose overhaul (3600w -> 1881w)`

**What was cut:**
- Redundant fire/building collapse descriptions (the fire was described 3-4 times — now once for barricades, once for the Anvil)
- The long screaming taxonomy (original had a full paragraph cataloguing screaming types by reference to prior battles — compressed to one tighter sentence)
- Stoneveil's internal monologue about what kind of speech a commander "should" give (cut entirely — his silence already says it)
- Repetitive boot-step descriptions for multiple characters
- The extended passage about the military machine "absorbing chaos" and the reports "always saying that"
- Over-narrated runner scene (the boy's trembling is enough — no need for the commander's-hand-on-shoulder hypothetical)

**What was preserved:**
- Every story beat: incendiaries, barricades, Harren's hesitation, the noncombatants, the order
- The Blackhand hammer scene (untouched — it's the heart of the chapter)
- The 912 dead, the forty-three under sixteen, the column with no heading
- The Daskell report and "Dead" exchange
- The Ironclaw intelligence foreshadowing ("six months, maybe less")
- The forward-flash to standing in the forge again (Ch. 18 payoff)
- "The language came easily. It always did." — the final gut-punch

The next task in the PRD is **Chapter 2 — The Horizon Darkens** (Thokk POV).

=== Iteration 2 ===
**Chapter 2 — THE HORIZON DARKENS — complete.**

**Summary:**
- **Before:** ~4,300 words
- **After:** 2,503 words (42% cut)
- **POV:** Thokk Ironhide — blunt, declarative, depth beneath simplicity

**What was cut:**
- Redundant descriptions of the War-Chiefs (long parenthetical bios compressed to essential character details)
- Extended internal monologue explaining the "two winters" desperation (now delivered once, cleanly)
- Over-explained orc customs and fire rituals
- Redundant closing meditation paragraphs that repeated themes already established

**What was preserved:**
- All 4 War-Chiefs named and characterized
- Grimtusk bone-reading + "seven strikes" prophecy
- Tactical assault plan with full dialogue
- "Two winters" survival motivation
- Thokk's wife / "the children needed to eat"
- The skull meditation / weight of command
- Defenders-as-mirror thematic beat
- Stonehaven reference (foreshadowing seed)
- Revenants / northern bogs (undead foreshadowing)
- Skrixx and the Jawbreaker

**Commit:** `6467123` — `edit: Chapter 2 — THE HORIZON DARKENS — prose overhaul (4300w -> 2503w)`

=== Iteration 3 ===
**Chapter 3 — THE SUNDERED GATE — Complete.**

**Results:** 5,700 words → 3,029 words (47% cut)

**What was cut:**
- Massive repetition of the 850 number and "the math" (appeared 5+ times, now 3 — the reveal, the math section, and the closing)
- Long explanatory passages after strong moments (e.g., paragraphs explaining what Veyne's silence means, what the runner's face means)
- The extended sunset/sky description  
- Redundant force composition details (kept the character of each group, cut the padding)
- Over-explained Blackthorn scroll implications (the "dispatched" beat hits once, hard)
- Repeated "it was not enough" / "resources were constrained" refrains
- The bloated Veyne character description that told instead of showed

**What was preserved:**
- Every story beat: gate inspection, wall circuit, eastern weakness, western subsidence, mining tunnels, Blackthorn's scroll, officer briefing, Veyne's deployment planning, Veilfire Spire coordination, the closing vigil
- Isolde Veyne's introduction — competent, clean, seeded for Book 2
- The 850 vs 2,500 arithmetic and its weight
- The Ironbound Guard betrayal
- "Dispatched" vs approved/mobilized
- The Anvil/forty-three reference
- Stoneveil's voice: military precision, controlled, cracks in what he doesn't say
- All foreshadowing seeds (rune-wards responding to threat, Veilfire Spire, Skrixx's engines)

=== Iteration 4 ===
**Chapter 4 — THE FIRST THUNDER — Complete.**

**7,600w → 3,021w (60% cut)**

What was cut:
- Massive over-explanation of the blast experience (the original spent ~600 words describing what thunder sounds like vs what this sounds like)
- Repeated descriptions of smoke, dust, ringing, silence — consolidated to strongest instances
- The extended internal monologue about being "invisible" — compressed to three sentences
- The compass meditation at the end — trimmed from ~800 words to ~200, trusting the reader who read Chapter 1
- Narrated emotional states ("the raw, exposed nerve of a man who had lost something and couldn't name it because naming it meant accepting it was lost") — kept the strongest version, cut the rest
- Extended descriptions of military movements that existed to tell the reader things November wouldn't care about in this moment

What was preserved:
- Every story beat: blast in training yard → running to Hall → finding Horus's ward → the direct hit → digging in rubble → soldier dragging him out → sergeant blocking re-entry → searching faces of the dead → gate closing → middle ring search → final compass check
- The concussive disorientation (short sentences, fragments, sensory chaos)
- The sergeant exchange ("All accessible areas have been swept")
- The gate moment ("In or out?")
- November's voice: blunt, no padding, shock doesn't narrate itself
- The Creed callbacks and the compass
- The closing mirror with Chapter 1 ("Standing. Sober. Alive.")

Committed as `e6106b0`. PRD and progress updated. Next task: **Chapter 5 — THE PRAYER** (Kael POV).

=== Iteration 5 ===
**Chapter 5 — THE PRAYER — Edit Complete.**

**Results:** 6,300w → ~2,850w (55% cut)

**What was cut:**
- Massive theological narration — paragraphs explaining what silence means, what prayer is, what the Inquisitorial Path represents
- Repeated passages about the Cathedral's architecture (the original described the same marble floor, the same windows, the same structural details multiple times)
- Over-explained moments — the original told the reader what the silence meant, then told them again, then told them what it meant that it didn't trouble him
- Redundant world-building exposition about the Emberheart's administrative structure, the Ironbound's history, the Chain of Command philosophy

**What was preserved:**
- All story beats: morning prayer, siege vibrations, weapon blessing, Inner Ring walk, Ironbound drilling, Veilfire Spire (brighter flames — foreshadowing), wounded arriving, inscriptions, evening prayer for Edric
- Kael's voice: formal, liturgical, structured like prayer
- The Edric thread — pulling strings, the gate garrison, the guilt
- Foreshadowing seeds: Veilfire Spire glow, Raventhorne's request, silence of the gods, Warded Archive role, Captain Veyne mention, dwarven-forged ironwork
- The "yet" — now lands clean at the end without being explained afterward

**Key improvements:**
- The "offered vs. recited" distinction now appears twice: once in the morning prayer (where the distinction is clear, faith intact) and once watching the wounded (where it should alarm him but doesn't) — subtle crack seeded
- The Scales of Veilfire passage retained as metaphor without the original's self-conscious note about filing things "too close to metaphor"
- The ending is tight: silence, kneel, the weight, "Yet." — one word, final line, no explanation

=== Iteration 6 ===
**Chapter 6 — THE WAVE — Edit Complete.**

- **Before:** ~4,400 words
- **After:** 2,985 words (32% reduction)
- **Committed:** `a0c218b`

**What was cut:**
- Excessive explanatory passages after strong moments (the doctrine explanation, the machine metaphor x3, the extended ward-failure narration)
- Redundant descriptions of Veyne's expressions and what they "meant"
- Over-narrated tactical details — the combat is now clipped and reported, matching Stoneveil's military voice
- The long extended ending that kept restating the same themes

**What was preserved:**
- All story beats: first assault, eastern breach, gate rams, rune-ward damage, casualty math (27 dead → 817 effective), the 43/43 Anvil echo, supply status, Blackthorn silence, ward degradation, "the machine runs until it breaks"
- Stoneveil's voice: controlled, tactical, cracks showing in what he doesn't say
- Veyne as reliable officer — slate, stylus, the drowning-man-boat metaphor
- Foreshadowing: Stonehaven reference, western flank quiet = sappers underground, ward failure trajectory
- The ending: "You watch what you order."

=== Iteration 7 ===
Done. **Chapter 7 — THE BORROWED SWORD** edited.

**Results:** 8,600 words → 3,720 words (57% cut)

**What was preserved:**
- November's first kill — the clumsy, ugly, artless violence. The brown eyes. The pulling of the blade. Every visceral beat intact.
- Edric's introduction — blacksmith's hands, the Anvil backstory, the shaking, the confession about the forge.
- The ankle grab — the defining November moment. "Who *does* that?"
- The bond — forged through shared survival, sealed with "Then I'll be beside you."
- The compass check-ins. The borrowed sword as symbol. The ending beat.
- The axe hit, Edric's shield over him, the getting-back-up cycle.

**What was cut:**
- Repeated descriptions of the same sensation (killing weight described 3x → 1x)
- Extended internal monologue explaining what emotions meant
- Over-described combat mechanics and blow-by-blow narration
- Redundant paragraph-after-paragraph explaining what just landed
- The lengthy "combat competence gap" narration — shown through action instead
- Explanatory passages about why November joined the line (the Creed moment speaks for itself)

=== Iteration 8 ===
**Chapter 8 — THE BONES SPEAK — complete.**

- **Before:** ~6,200 words
- **After:** 2,753 words (55% cut)
- **Committed:** `09fcc6a`

**What was cut:**
- Extensive explanatory passages about orc death rites (what the bone-ash means, what the three lines symbolize, why armour is stripped — the reader learns by watching Thokk do the rites, not by being told)
- Repeated descriptions of the fire and smoke during the pyre scene
- Over-described Skrixx introduction (his smell, his eyes, his body — trimmed to essentials)
- Redundant casualty arithmetic (the numbers were restated and reprocessed multiple times)
- Explanatory narration after strong moments (e.g., "That was the weight" passages)
- The "thinning" metaphor was used 5+ times — cut to the two strongest

**What was preserved:**
- All casualty reports (Malga, Krogan, Gharza, Urzag, Skrixx)
- Revenants debate — full exchange intact
- Skrixx's ward-cracking report and tunnel plan
- Thokk protecting goblin crews ("Goblins are dying in my service. Dat makes dem mine.")
- Death rites — Key Moment #7 — Grukk, Krogan's son, unnamed recruits
- Grimtusk's bone reading — cracked wolf knuckle, the number seven, thinning connection
- Pyre scene with ancestor-presence
- Mirror with human commander
- Closing image — cracked bone, waiting for dawn, "like roots in bad soil"
