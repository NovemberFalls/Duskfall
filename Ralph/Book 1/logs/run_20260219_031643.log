=== Iteration 1 ===
All three background agents have now reported in. All that research was already consumed during the writing of Chapter 19. Everything is complete and committed.

**Current status:** 19 of 28 chapters written. Next task is **Chapter 20 — The Spirits Grow Quiet** (Thokk Ironhide POV, Day 5).

=== Iteration 2 ===
**Chapter 20 — THE SPIRITS GROW QUIET** is complete and committed.

**Summary of what was written:**

Thokk presses into the Anvil District on Day 5. The street fighting is brutal — worse than the walls. His warriors are dying in alleys and chokepoints, eaten by the human commander's fortified ruins. The central thread: Grimtusk tells Thokk the spirits have gone quiet. Not confused, not restless — *far*. The bones fall cold. The death rites produce smoke but no passage. The channel between the living and the dead is closing.

Key beats:
- **The alleys as meat grinder** — 12 warriors in, 4 back. The firebombed district has been turned into a fortress (*ghar-rukk*).
- **Grimtusk's revelation** — "Da dead went into da fire. What came out was smoke. Just smoke."
- **Malga's arm is dying** — veins black, infection spreading. She offers to fight left-handed. Thokk orders her to the shamans.
- **The secondary barricade holds** — Gharza's assault hits a trap. 14 dead in 2 minutes.
- **Skrixx's tunnel gambit** — charges placed under the barricade via old sewers. His best fuse-cutter is dead. Skrixx will cut the fuses himself.
- **The unwalked rites** — for the first time, Thokk does not walk among his dead. The parallel with the Revenants grows: warriors dying unburned, unmarked, "just dead."

~4,200 words. The chapter deepens the spiritual decay thread (Veilfire corruption), maintains the mirror theme between Thokk and Stoneveil, and sets up Skrixx's survival/escape for future books.

=== Iteration 3 ===
**Chapter 21 — THE BREAKING POINT** is complete and committed.

**What was written:** Kael Veyne's fifth POV chapter (~4,600 words), containing **KEY MOMENT #8 (Kael's Failed Healing)**. The chapter takes Kael from the Cathedral to the front lines of the Anvil District, where the triage system has collapsed under the weight of Day 5's casualties.

**The Key Moment:** Kael abandons the Last Passing for the first time and reaches for the Healing Invocation — a direct petition for divine intervention taught as theology, never practiced. He prays with raw, unstructured desperation: *"Heal her. Please."* The silence answers. The child dies. Her grip releases finger by finger — the same sequence as the boy on Day 2, closing the loop. Kael cannot complete the Rite over the body.

**The arc's progression across five chapters:**
- Ch 5: Faith intact, silence does not trouble him. *"Yet."*
- Ch 9: Ground shifts. The boy's hand goes slack.
- Ch 13: Silence louder. Marrow's cruelty. Doubt sounds like doubt.
- Ch 17: The cracking. He does not kneel.
- **Ch 21: The fracture.** Faith's architecture collapses. What remains is smaller — "the prayer of being there. The prayer that had no words." The broken man kneels anyway.

=== Iteration 4 ===
**Chapter 22 — THE LAST WALL** is complete and committed.

**Summary of what was written:**

Stoneveil's POV, Dawn of Day 6. ~3,400 words. The chapter covers:

- **The count:** 347 effective strength remaining (from 850 on Day 1). The night assault cost 133. The secondary barricade held thanks to Dorran's engineering.
- **Blackthorn's refusal:** "The Emberheart must hold. All other positions are expendable." No reserves are coming. Stoneveil recognizes this as his own doctrine from Ashgate — and the recognition is the worst part.
- **The final report:** Stoneveil dictates his last communication. "No further reports will be sent."
- **Walking the line:** He inspects the battered positions — Corporal Tesswin holding the northern barricade with 11 soldiers in a spot designed for 30, the crossbow team in the collapsible chimney, the child's drawing he refuses to look at again.
- **The charges:** Dorran discovered Skrixx's demolition charges under the secondary barricade. Can't disarm, can't flood the tunnels. They wait.
- **The address:** Not a speech. Facts. "We hold this ground. Not because we can win. Because this is where we are and there is no other place to go." No cheers. No salutes. They go to their positions.
- **Closing:** Stoneveil presses both hands on the anvil. The left hand won't stop trembling. He keeps pressing anyway.

=== Iteration 5 ===
**Chapter 23 — THE MAN WHO WOULD NOT LEAVE** is complete and committed.

**What was written (~5,800 words):**

- **November and Edric reunite** at the secondary barricade after being separated by the wall collapse in Chapter 19. Thirteen defenders hold a position built for thirty.
- **The barricade fight** — orcs bring a ram, then ladders. November fights badly, desperately, goes down twice, gets back up each time. The soldiers around him see the civilian who won't stop standing and gravitate toward him — the magnetic effect.
- **Skrixx's charges blow the barricade** at the ninth bell (payoff from Ch.22's setup). The basalt wall is destroyed. Seven defenders remain.
- **Edric Thane dies.** A heavy orc's sword finds the gap below his ribs. November catches him, holds his hand. Edric asks November to look after his mother and sisters. His last words: *"I said I'd be beside you. I'm beside you."* — a callback to the promise he made in Ch.7. He dies the way nineteen-year-olds die in sieges: too fast, too afraid, reaching for someone's hand. No speech. No neat bow. Just silence.
- **November stands.** Compass check. Lays Edric down. Picks up the sword. Walks toward the fighting. Five defenders holding for five minutes while the gate detail pulls civilians through. Too tight. The same mistake. The orcs come. November Falls does not leave.

=== Iteration 6 ===
**Chapter 24 — THE GATE is complete.** Here's a summary:

**POV:** Thokk Ironhide | **Setting:** The Anvil District, Day 6 | **~7,400 words**

The chapter follows Thokk's final push through the Anvil District after Skrixx's charges blow the secondary barricade. Key beats:

- **The balance tips.** Thokk recognises that the human defense is breaking — retreats are faster, positions undermanned, the commander running out of bodies.
- **Spirits fully gone.** Grimtusk reports the spiritual channel is closed, not closing. He didn't cast the bones for the first time in forty years. The rites will be empty ritual. Thokk: *"Den we fight without dem."*
- **Malga Bonefist dies.** The poisoned arm from Day 2 finally takes her — shamans amputated but the poison was past the shoulder. Her last words: *"Tell da Blood-Chief I went first."* Drekkha inherits the vanguard.
- **Skrixx sent to the ridge.** Thokk orders the Pyrelord to pull his 46 surviving goblins to the ridge and survive — positioning him for the escape the foreshadowing requires.
- **Thokk at the front.** He commits all warbands and leads from the front himself. Building by building, the Ironclaw press through the crumbling defense to the dormitory wall, the last line.
- **The commander.** Thokk sees Stoneveil standing at the gate — not behind it, in front of it. Recognises the posture as his own. The mirror. Two men at the end of the same arithmetic. The chapter ends with Thokk walking toward him.

Directly sets up Chapter 25 — The Seventh Strike.

=== Iteration 7 ===
**Chapter 25 — THE SEVENTH STRIKE** is complete and committed.

**What was written:** The climactic duel between Stoneveil and Thokk at the gate to the Inner Ring. ~4,800 words, Stoneveil POV.

**Key Moment #9 delivered:**
- Seven strikes, explicitly numbered and bolded — each exchange ugly, exhausted, not elegant
- Thokk dies standing, as the old ways demand — falls forward, toward the gate he was trying to reach
- The orc assault fragments from the loss of their leader, not from defeat
- Skrixx torches his siege engines and escapes north with 46 goblins
- Stoneveil kneels beside the body — not in triumph but in recognition that the man he killed was the other side of the same wall
- The forty-three grows — the number expands to encompass the full siege's cost, the carrying that never ends

**Continuity maintained** with Ch.22 (347 effective, tremoring hand, Veyne's slate), Ch.23 (barricade blown, Tesswin), and Ch.24 (Thokk's approach, the tower shield, the skull, the cold wolf knuckle, the number seven resolving as the seven strikes).

**Next task:** Chapter 26 — THE SILENCE AFTER (November Falls POV, Key Moment #10 — The Search).

=== Iteration 8 ===
**Chapter 26 — THE SILENCE AFTER** is complete.

**What was written:** November Falls POV, ~4,500 words. KEY MOMENT #10 (The Search). The fighting stops. November stands in the aftermath — 72 survivors, the Anvil District a graveyard. He checks the compass (Standing? Sober? The Creed?) and the needle points at the absence: Horus.

**Key scenes:**
- Returns to Edric's body. Promises to find his mother and sisters. Promises to deliver the unfinished message to Kael: *"Tell Kael I—"*
- Searches for two hours — every face, every body, the triage stations, the mass graves, the service corridor
- Returns to the Hall of the Fallen, their home. The alcove behind the linen shelves is buried under rubble. The window that caught the morning light is broken. She is not there.
- Sits in the street with Darya's sword across his knees. *"Too tight. The same mistake. He would make it for the rest of his life."*
- The hollowness: not grief (grief requires certainty), but the thing before grief. The compass points north. He will find her. The silence is full of her name.

**Continuity:** All wounds carried forward. Darya's sword, Edric's body placement, Tesswin's survival, Stoneveil in the courtyard with Thokk's body, the boy runner with the arrow — all consistent with Chapters 23-25. Callbacks to Chapter 1's Last Good Morning throughout.

**Next task:** Chapter 27 — THE CONSCRIPTION (Phase 8, Task 1).

=== Iteration 9 ===
**Chapter 27 — THE CONSCRIPTION** is complete and committed.

**What was written:** November Falls's conscription into the Emberfall Legion, days after the siege ends. Key Moment #11 delivered. ~4,200 words.

**Key scenes:**
- The processing station in the courtyard where Thokk died — the empire sends a clerk before it sends reinforcements
- November watches survivors processed (Tesswin, Sorren Dall, Pell named for the first time)
- Lieutenant Aldara Cael delivers the conscription order — Veyne's report mentions November eleven times
- November takes the oath immediately, kneeling on the cobblestones where the Warlord fell — entering the machine deliberately, on his terms
- Salvaged armour from the dead — does not fit, the gap between borrowed things and the body wearing them
- Delivers Edric's unfinished sentence to Kael Veyne — "Tell Kael I—" — the dash preserved, Kael's fractured faith visible
- Walks through the open gate into the intact Inner Ring — the compass files the gap without judgment
- Final compass check in the garrison barracks: Standing, sober, the Creed. The compass points north. She is out there. He will find her. November Falls is a beginning.

**Tone:** Determined, cold. A broken man picking up a new set of chains because they lead in the direction he needs to go.

**Next task:** Phase 8, Task 2 — Chapter 28: THE SKULL (Stoneveil POV, short epilogue).

=== Iteration 10 ===
**Chapter 28 — THE SKULL is complete.**

This is the final chapter of the book — Stoneveil's short epilogue. Here's what it delivers:

**Key Moment #12 — The Silence After (Stoneveil):** Stoneveil alone in the ruins, 72 survivors, the unanswered question: *was it worth it?*

**Structure:**
- The Warlord's skull arrives as a war trophy from Blackthorn — cleaned, bleached, the jaw missing from Stoneveil's pommel blow. Stoneveil places it on the anvil in Blackhand's forge.
- He writes the after-action report. The numbers: 850 to 72. "The city held." The cost — the sentence that doesn't make it into reports.
- He walks the Anvil District — barricades dismantled, mass graves covered, the Sundered Gate damaged but standing. Beyond: rubble, empty hills, grey horizon.
- He looks at his hands. Clean. The blood is still there — not the siege blood, the Anvil blood. The firebombing. The forty-three. The stain that's in the hands, not on them.
- The question: *Was it worth it?* No answer. The question sits in the silence the way the skull sits on the anvil. The wind moves through the ruins.

**Final image:** The sound of wind through stone. The only answer the Anvil has left to give.

**Note:** Bash was unavailable, so the git commit couldn't be performed. You'll need to run:
```
git -C "C:/Users/lenbo/Dropbox/_DND_Duskfall/Duskfall" add "Book 1/Chapters/28 - The Skull.md"
git -C "C:/Users/lenbo/Dropbox/_DND_Duskfall/Duskfall" commit -m "feat: write Chapter 28 - The Skull (Stoneveil POV, Phase 8 Task 2)"
```

The PRD and progress.txt have been updated. All 28 chapters (Prologue + 26 chapters + Epilogue) are now drafted. The next tasks are Phase 9 — Polish and Continuity (continuity pass, emotional arc verification, foreshadowing verification, final commit).

**Phase 9, Task 3 — Foreshadowing Verification: COMPLETE**

Here's the summary:

**12 of 14 threads are planted and working:**
- Captain Isolde Veyne (appears across 8+ chapters, survives)
- November's conscription (Ch. 27)
- Broken orc horde after Thokk's death (Ch. 25, 28)
- November's missing healer / the search (central thread, spine of the book)
- November's brother (Ch. 26 — single, appropriately understated reference)
- Undead presence via Revenants (Ch. 2, 8, 12, 16, 20, 23, 24)
- Planar rifts / barrier thinning (Ch. 8, 20)
- Silence of the gods (all Kael chapters)
- November's Creed (all November chapters)
- Stonehaven (7+ chapters)
- Skrixx Blazebinder survives and escapes (Ch. 20, 24, 25, 28)
- Veilfire Spire glows brighter during battle (Ch. 3, 5, 10)

**2 threads are missing or incomplete:**
1. **Elven civil war / Twilight Faction** — No mention anywhere. Needs a passing reference (natural insertion points: Ch. 3 briefing, Ch. 5 war-mage encounter, or Ch. 10 supply discussion).
2. **Necrobyss by name / "tar-like terrain near the coast"** — The Revenants cover the undead theme broadly, but the specific Necrobyss/coastal reference from the foreshadowing doc is absent.

The remaining PRD task is the **Final commit** (Phase 9, Task 4), which stages all chapter files for a single commit.
