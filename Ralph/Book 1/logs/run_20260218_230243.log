=== Iteration 1 ===
**Phase 1, Task 1 — Continuity Audit: COMPLETE**

Here's what I found after reading all 10 planning documents:

**1 minor issue flagged** (not fixed — author's territory):
- The **Themes and Emotional Beats** doc (Day 2 section) references "Edric's first kill" — but this should be "November's first kill" per Key Moments #3 and the PRD. Edric is a trained Legionnaire who likely already has kills; Chapter 7 ("The Borrowed Sword") is about *November's* first kill.

**Everything else is clean:**
- "Horus" is consistent across all documents
- Edric Thane dies on Day 6, Chapter 23 — consistent everywhere
- Skrixx Blazebinder survives and escapes — consistent everywhere
- 72 survivors, 850 defenders, 2,500+ attackers — all match
- Kael Veyne is Edric's uncle — consistent across POV Characters and PRD
- All 12 Key Moments match their chapter assignments
- 6-day timeline maps correctly to the chapter structure
- Stoneveil's rank, title, and history are consistent
- November's Dilemma decision point is already resolved by the author

The planning foundation is solid. The next task is **Phase 1, Task 2: Edric Thane character sketch**.

=== Iteration 2 ===
**Phase 1, Task 2 complete.**

Wrote `Book 1/Noteworthy/04 - Edric Thane - Secondary Character.md` -- Edric's full secondary character profile covering:

- **Background:** 19yo son of a blacksmith killed in the Anvil firebombing. Enlisted because the pension wasn't enough. Kael Veyne's nephew.
- **Personality:** Afraid but willing. Shakes before every assault, talks too much when scared, stands his ground anyway. Not brave -- *willing*.
- **Relationship with November:** Follows November's conviction, not his sword skill. Edric is the better fighter by training, but November is the anchor.
- **Heart-winning moment:** Day 3 lull -- tells November about his father's forge, the sound an anvil makes when struck right.
- **Death:** Day 6, Ch.23. No speeches. Dies too fast, reaching for someone's hand. November holds it.
- **Thematic role:** Theme #4 (Innocence as Currency). Bridges Kael and Stoneveil's arcs.

PRD checked off. Progress logged. Committed as `1164887`. Next task: **Phase 1, Task 3 -- Horus character sketch**.

=== Iteration 3 ===
**Phase 1, Task 3 complete.** Wrote the Horus character sketch to `Book 1/Noteworthy/05 - Horus - The Healer.md`.

The sketch covers:
- **Appearance & bearing** — Lean, practical, calloused hands. Carries herself like someone who's already seen the worst thing today and chose to keep working.
- **Personality** — Sharp when tired. Teases November. Her honesty is her kindness. Refuses to agree with his worst self-assessment.
- **What she means to November** — She didn't save him. She was the first person who looked at him without looking away. He hated her patience before he understood it.
- **Chapter 1 specifics** — The heel of bread she saves him. Hair blown from her face mid-surgery. Morning light through narrow windows. The silence between two people who know what solitude costs.
- **Reader attachment strategy** — Love through accumulation of small, irreplaceable details, so her absence feels like amputation.

**Phase 1 is now fully complete.** All three pre-writing validation tasks are done. The next task is Phase 2: writing the Prologue.

=== Iteration 4 ===
**Prologue — THE ANVIL is complete.** Committed as `0d35d12`.

Here's what I wrote:

**POV:** Warden Alric Stoneveil (~3,200 words)

**The chapter delivers:**
- **Stoneveil's moral weight** — He orders the incendiary bombardment, overrides Captain Harren's hesitation about noncombatants, and watches until the screaming stops. He does not look away. That's his rule.
- **Drelgar Blackhand's death** — The Forge-King dies with dignity. His last act is raising his hammer at the anvil, finishing his work as the forge collapses around him. He dies standing — a mirror of how Thokk will die standing in Ch.25.
- **Grimdark tone** — 912 dead, 43 under the age of sixteen. The numbers appear in the report in a column without a heading. No clean heroes. No comfortable answers.
- **Stoneveil's voice** — Military precision. Controlled. The cracks show in what he *doesn't* think about: the forty-three. He suppresses them deliberately. Files them. Moves on.
- **Forward-planted symmetry** — The final paragraphs reference that Stoneveil will return to this exact spot during the siege (Ch.18), and the forty-three will become all he can think about.
- **Foreshadowing** — Scout reports arrive: Ironclaw war-parties massing on the ridgeline. Six months, maybe less.
- **The last line** — "The language came easily. It always did." — tells the reader everything about who Stoneveil is and what this story is about.

=== Iteration 5 ===
**Chapter 1 — THE LAST GOOD MORNING** is complete.

**What was written:** ~4,200 words. November Falls POV. KEY MOMENT #1. A quiet morning in Emberfall before the siege destroys everything.

**Structure:**
1. November wakes before dawn, watches Horus sleeping
2. Trains alone at the post — sloppy, earnest, dropping his guard on the left
3. Returns to the Hall; Horus is elbow-deep in a wound, diagnoses his swordwork from a blister
4. They share bread in the alcove — she saved him the heel
5. He recites the Creed; the silence after is full
6. He walks the Hall with her — holds a soldier's arm, sits with a widow
7. Returns to the yard. Drops his guard. Resets. Tries again.

**Key beats landed:**
- Love through accumulation of small, specific details (the heel of bread, the shoulder pressed against his, the hair she blows from her face)
- November is never the best at anything physical — his swordwork is explicitly bad
- The Creed recited in full for the first time
- Inner compass used as structural anchor
- No melodrama. Two imperfect people eating bad bread in thin light.
- The chapter exists so that Chapter 4 can destroy the reader.

=== Iteration 6 ===
**Chapter 2 — THE HORIZON DARKENS** is complete.

**What was written:** ~3,500 words from Thokk Ironhide's POV. He surveys his army from the ridge above Emberfall at dusk before the siege.

**Key beats landed:**
- **Army composition**: 1,200 Ironclaw warriors, 800 goblin sappers with siege engines, 500 Revenants in reserve
- **Grimtusk's bone-reading**: Omens unclear — spirits confused, connections thinning, blood flowing in every direction. Also reveals the number **seven** (foreshadowing Thokk's death in Ch.25)
- **War-Chiefs council**: Four commanders introduced (Malga Bonefist, Krogan Bloodtusk, Gharza Splitjaw, Urzag the Quiet) with distinct personalities
- **The central truth**: Two winters before the Ironclaw starve. This is not a raid — it's survival
- **Humanization**: Thokk remembers his dead wife, his children, Bloodtide Bay. He doesn't hate the humans. He recognizes the mirror — both sides defending what they have
- **Voice**: Blunt, declarative, short muscular sentences. Orcish dialect in dialogue. Internal monologue reveals surprising depth beneath the simplicity

**Foreshadowing planted**: Seven strikes, spirits thinning (Veilfire corruption), Skrixx's survival, Revenants/undead threat, Krogan Bloodtusk (Book 2), Stonehaven reference, Thokk's chain-of-Warlords imagery.

=== Iteration 7 ===
**Chapter 3 — The Sundered Gate** is complete.

**Summary:** Stoneveil inspects the Iron Marches and the Sundered Gate on Day 1, before the siege opens. Captain Isolde Veyne delivers the troop report: 850 combat-ready. He walks the full circuit — identifies the patched eastern wall (the same weakness Thokk spotted from the ridge in Ch.2), the subsidence on the western flank over old mining tunnels, and orders defensive preparations. A scroll from Lord Commander Blackthorn confirms the Ironbound Guard will not be redeployed, and reinforcements have only been "dispatched" — the bureaucratic word for *no one is coming*. Stoneveil briefs his officers on the ramparts, Veyne distributes defensive assignments, and the chapter ends with Stoneveil alone on the wall at nightfall, doing the math he won't share with anyone, waiting for the war.

**Key elements:**
- Tactical gap established: 850 vs 2,500, no reserves, no reinforcements
- Isolde Veyne introduced as Stoneveil's most competent officer (Book 2 seed)
- Blackthorn's political distance and cowardice shown through the scroll
- Both flanks' vulnerabilities mirror what Thokk identified in Ch.2 — convergence
- Stoneveil's voice maintained: military precision, cracks in what he *doesn't* think about
- ~3,800 words

=== Iteration 8 ===
Chapter 4 — THE FIRST THUNDER is complete.

**Summary:**

- **POV:** November Falls
- **KEY MOMENT #2:** The Blast
- **Word count:** ~4,800 words
- **File:** `Book 1/Chapters/04 - The First Thunder.md`

The chapter opens with November in the training yard — still working that left-side gap — when the first siege engine rounds hit. The blast destroys the eastern wall of the Hall of the Fallen. November is thrown across the room, deafened, his left arm injured. He crawls through rubble to the overflow ward where Horus was last seen. The ceiling has collapsed. He digs with one hand. Finds nothing.

Soldiers evacuate him. He searches the streets — every stretcher, every cart, every body. She is not among them. A sergeant blocks him from re-entering. The secondary gate is closing. He steps through. In the middle ring, he checks hundreds of faces among the refugees. Nothing.

The compass degrades from Ch.1's *Standing. Sober. Useful. Loved.* to *Standing. Sober. Alive.* — the loss is measured in what the compass can no longer confirm.

The next incomplete task is **Chapter 5 — THE PRAYER** (Kael Veyne's first POV chapter).

**Chapter 5 — THE PRAYER is complete.**

Phase 2 is now finished. All six Day 1 chapters are written:
- Prologue — The Anvil (Stoneveil)
- Ch.1 — The Last Good Morning (November)
- Ch.2 — The Horizon Darkens (Thokk)
- Ch.3 — The Sundered Gate (Stoneveil)
- Ch.4 — The First Thunder (November)
- **Ch.5 — The Prayer (Kael Veyne)** ← just completed

**Chapter summary:** Kael Veyne's introduction establishes faith as a pillar before the siege cracks it. He blesses 43 weapons in the Cathedral's armoury chapel, walks the Inner Ring observing the Ironbound Guard drilling and the Veilfire Spire burning brighter than usual, and returns to pray. His formal liturgical voice holds steady throughout — until the private, unstructured prayer for his nephew Edric breaks through the theology. The chapter ends with Kael alone in the nave, the silence answering his prayer, and the word "yet" living beneath the surface like a crack in marble.

Key seeds planted:
- The silence of the gods as Kael's central condition (will fracture in Ch.9, 13, 21)
- Edric placed on the wall by Kael's intervention (guilt pre-loaded for Ch.17)
- Veilfire Spire "reaching" beyond normal operations (series arc)
- Varian Marrow present by oblique reference (foreshadows Ch.13)
- 43 weapons blessed — echoing the 43 children from the Prologue

**Next task:** Phase 3, Task 1 — Chapter 6: THE WAVE (Stoneveil POV, Day 2).

=== Iteration 10 ===
**Chapter 6 — THE WAVE** is complete and committed.

**Summary of what was written:**

Stoneveil commands from the gate rampart as the first full orc assault hits on Day 2. Two waves — dawn and midday — strike the Sundered Gate and eastern wall simultaneously. Key beats:

- **Eastern breach**: Scaling ladders at three points, Ironclaw warriors establish briefly on the parapet before being cut off and killed. Auxiliaries prove they can fight — barely.
- **Gate assault**: Ram crews hit the Sundered Gate. Rune-wards repulse the rams. The Veil's Throat becomes a killing ground — 43 orc dead (echoing the 43 children from the Prologue).
- **Second assault adaptation**: The enemy learns. Testudo formations, heavier rams, faster ladders. The eastern wall buckles before ballista three cuts the supply line.
- **The ledger**: 27 dead, 41 wounded. 809 effective from 850. Supplies at 55-70%. Three to four days at current rate. The machine works. The numbers are wrong.
- **Rune-ward degradation**: The dwarven enchantments are being spent. The gate will eventually become ordinary iron.
- **The silence**: No third assault. The orc commander regroups. The silence is not peace — it's reloading.

~3,800 words. Stoneveil's voice maintained throughout — the controlled, measured prose of a man holding the ledger of war, the cracks visible only in what he doesn't think about (the forty-three, the Anvil, the gap between the machine working and the math being wrong).

=== Iteration 11 ===
**Chapter 7 — THE BORROWED SWORD is complete.**

**What was written (~4,800 words):**

- **Key Moment #3 delivered:** November's first kill — clumsy, ugly, not heroic. The orc's brown eyes, the sucking resistance of pulling the blade free, the smell of blood, the shaking hands. The kill rendered as weight, not triumph.

- **Edric Thane introduced:** 19yo Legionnaire with a blacksmith's hands and too-wide eyes. Shaking before the fight, talks too much when scared, but stands his ground every time. His father "had" a forge in the Anvil — the firebombing made personal in a single past tense. He latches onto November not for his skill but for his steadiness.

- **The bond forged:** November grabs an orc's ankle from the ground to save Edric. Edric shields November when the axe hits his left side (the same gap). They sit together in the rubble afterward — November present with Edric's pain the way he sat with the widow. Edric's final line: "Then I'll be beside you."

- **Continuity maintained:** Left arm injury from Ch.4, blister and Horus's bandage from Ch.1, civilian combat vocabulary, the compass structure, outer ring geography matching Ch.4 and Ch.6, the dropped guard on the left side paying off as a combat wound.

Next task in the PRD: **Chapter 8 — THE BONES SPEAK** (Thokk POV, Key Moment #7 Part 1: Death Rites).

**Chapter 8 — The Bones Speak** is complete.

**Summary of what was written:**
- ~3,800 words, Thokk Ironhide POV, Day 2 evening after the first full assault
- **Key Moment #7 Part 1 (Thokk's Death Rites):** Thokk receives casualty reports from each War-Chief, tallies 145 Ironclaw dead (1,055 effective, down from 1,200), then walks among the dead at moonrise performing the rites himself — bone-ash paste, three lines of passage, fist over the heart, direct words to each fallen warrior
- Gharza pushes for deploying the Revenants; Thokk refuses on moral grounds — orc blood earns the right to the city, dead things buy nothing
- Skrixx reports 31 goblins dead, cracked Jawbreaker arm, but progress on eastern ward degradation and western tunnels — estimates the wall falls on day four or five
- Grimtusk's second bone-reading: spirits escalated from "confused" to "agitated," a wolf knuckle cracked during casting (unprecedented), the number SEVEN persists with growing weight behind it
- The funeral pyres burn. Thokk watches Emberfall's fires across the valley and recognizes the human commander doing the same arithmetic. "He understood him. That was worse."
- Continuity verified against Ch.2, Ch.6, and Ch.7 — all numbers, names, events, and geography align

**Chapter 9 — THE FIRST RITES** is complete.

**Summary of what was written:**

Kael Veyne moves between the triage stations in the Anvil District and the walls, administering last rites to seven dead on Day 2. Two deaths anchor the chapter:

1. **The boy** — a fifteen-year-old auxiliary who dies holding Kael's hand, his last word shaped as "mum." The Rite completes over him, but neither prayer nor mother's name reaches anyone.

2. **The soldier** — a Legionnaire from the gate garrison, dying of an evisceration wound with discipline and clarity. He speaks the Soldier's Invocation while Kael speaks the Last Passing — the two prayers collide in the air and both dissolve into nothing. The prayer didn't save him.

Kael deploys "This is Tyr's will" — the trained mechanism — and for the first time notices it functioning as machinery rather than faith. He returns to the Cathedral at dusk and confesses in prayer: the Rite felt hollow. The boy was fifteen. The soldier held the wall.

**The crack hasn't appeared yet. But the ground shifts, slightly.**

Phase 3 (Day 2 — First Blood) is now complete. The next task is Phase 4, Chapter 10 — THE MATHEMATICS OF BLOOD (Stoneveil POV, Day 3).

=== Iteration 14 ===
**Chapter 10 — THE MATHEMATICS OF BLOOD is complete.**

**What was written:** A ~3,900-word Stoneveil POV chapter covering Day 3 of the siege. The chapter captures the grinding, erosive phase where the orc commander shifts from full assaults to probing attacks, wearing the defense down through constant pressure rather than overwhelming force.

**Key elements delivered:**
- Stoneveil manages rotations (shortened from 4-hour to 3-hour watches), repairs, and supplies — all declining
- **The triage decision**: 43 wounded, 12 critical — 8 treatable, 4 terminal. Stoneveil orders comfort care only for the four. Correct decision. Worst decision.
- Eats standing up, sword still in hand, hasn't slept (~50 hours)
- **The tremor**: left hand shakes when holding the water cup. Right hand (sword hand) steady. The man vs. the machine.
- **The bodies in the Throat**: not ordered removed because they slow the ram crews. The dead as a resource.
- Supply countdown: arrows 51%, bolts 43%, alchemy 36%, oil two days remaining, grain reduced by a third
- Rune-ward countdown: eastern bastion one day from failure, gate two to three days
- Effective garrison: 770 (from 850 on Day 1)
- Blackthorn's silence continues. Ironbound Guard still not deployed.

**Foreshadowing planted:** Western tunnel sappers advancing, ward failure timeline setting up the outer ring's fall on Day 4, Veilfire Spire flames intensifying, the forty-three echo recurring.

**Chapter 11 — The Compass** is complete.

**What was written:** A ~3,600 word chapter from November Falls' POV on Day 3 of the siege. The chapter shows November's value in the spaces between combat — carrying water to the wall, dragging wounded to triage, standing extra shifts because his five-hour sleep cycle gives him three hours that everyone else doesn't have.

**Key moments delivered:**
- **Edric's heart-winning scene:** Edric tells November about his father's forge — the sound an anvil makes when struck right, falling asleep to that ring as a boy. "I miss that sound." Four words carrying the full cost of the Anvil firebombing distilled to one boy's loss.
- **The compass check:** Standing. Sober. Useful. Not the way a soldier is useful — the water carrier, the pallet dragger, the man who stands the extra shift. The smallest useful thing, done again and again. That is enough.
- **Bond deepening:** Edric gives November cloth to bind his injured elbow. November stands Edric's watch while the boy sleeps. The care flows both directions now.

**Continuity maintained:** Left arm injury progressing, borrowed sword, rune-ward degradation, compass structure evolving, Horus's absence as a wound, the widow callback from Ch.1, atmospheric details consistent across all chapters.

**Chapter 12 — THE PRICE OF FEEDING** is complete. Here's a summary:

**POV:** Warlord Thokk Ironhide | **Day 3** | **~3,600 words**

**What the chapter covers:**

- **Supply crisis:** Quartermaster Durra reveals food is running out — twelve days of supplies half-consumed in three. Thokk orders the cut to march rations.
- **War-Chiefs council:** Updated losses (167 Ironclaw dead, 49 goblins, Revenants untouched). Krogan reports the humans are adapting — shorter watches, thicker wall coverage. Gharza reports sappers 40 feet under the western wall. Thokk orders a coordinated breach: eastern wards go dark and western wall collapses in the same hour.
- **Skrixx demands timber and alchemist's fire.** Thokk strips the camp palisade for seasoned wood. Skrixx's payment for breaking the wall is the city's supply stores: "Ya eat what ya kill."
- **The recognition:** Thokk alone on the ridge, watching the defenders' desperation shift from Day 1's adrenaline to Day 3's cold, grinding endurance. He recognises it because it lives in him. The difference between the two commanders is geography, not character. This unsettles him deeply — Theme #2 (The Enemy is a Mirror) at its fullest articulation.
- **Final image:** The children at Bloodtide Bay. The price of feeding is the warriors spent to break the wall so children who will never see the blood can eat.

All continuity checks pass against Ch.2, Ch.8, Ch.10, and Ch.11. Committed to `main`.

**Chapter 13 — THE SILENCE is complete.**

Phase 4 is now finished. All four Day 3 chapters (Ch.10-13) are done. Here's what the chapter covers:

**POV:** Inquisitor Adept Kael Veyne | **Day 3** | **~3,800 words**

Key beats:
- **The silence is louder.** Kael's morning prayer arrives in words but not in faith — the distinction between the vessel and its contents made explicit.
- **High Inquisitor Varian Marrow** fully introduced: gaunt, severe, iron gauntlet on his burned left hand, faith refined into pure function with compassion stripped away. "Compassion is not a principle. It is a sensation. Sensations do not hold walls."
- **Deserter execution:** Legionnaire Caedus Wrent sentenced to death for leaving the wall after two days. Kael witnesses and administers the Rite. Wrent dies without speaking.
- **Kael sees his future** in Marrow's cruelty and recoils — but the alternative is doubt, and doubt does not hold walls, and doubt does not protect Edric.
- **The confession:** For the first time, Kael admits directly: "I confess that the silence troubles me." The progression from Ch.5 ("yet") to Ch.9 (ground-shift) to Ch.13 (the silence troubles him) continues deepening without breaking.
- **Final question:** Is it faith or numbness? Kael cannot tell the difference. The distinction may be the most important question he has ever failed to answer.

The next incomplete task is **Phase 5, Task 1: Chapter 14 — THE OUTER RING FALLS** (Stoneveil POV, Day 4).

**Chapter 14 — THE OUTER RING FALLS** is complete. Here's a summary:

**POV:** Warden Alric Stoneveil | **Day 4** | **~3,800 words**

**What happens:**
- The eastern bastion's wards die at dawn — fading, not collapsing
- Goblin sappers blow the western wall at the subsidence point (the exact weak spot Stoneveil identified on Day 1), collapsing thirty feet of wall
- The eastern assault hits twelve minutes later — coordinated, full commitment against the unenchanted bastion
- Both flanks fall simultaneously. Stoneveil orders retreat to the Anvil District (middle ring)
- **The thirteen:** Thirteen immobile wounded left behind in the outer ring triage station. A volunteer medic (an 18-year-old surgeon's apprentice) stays with them. Stoneveil does not look back.
- Sergeant Dorran fights a bloody delay action — 46 down to 23 survivors through the Anvil Gate
- **Effective strength drops to 512** (from 770 at end of Day 3)
- Stoneveil enters Drelgar Blackhand's forge as his new command post. Stands at the anvil. The forty-three arrive uninvited — the locked door will not hold in this place. His right hand is steady; his left hand trembles against the cold iron.
- He turns and begins giving orders. The orders come easily. They always do.

**Key motifs:** The "correct decision" refrain reaches its most devastating expression — the retreat is correct, the triage is correct, every decision is correct, and correctness is the worst thing about it. The distinction between ordering something done and ordering something *not done*.

**Chapter 15 — THE RETREAT** is complete. Here's what was written:

**POV:** November Falls | **Day 4** | **~4,600 words**

**KEY MOMENT #4: The Wounded Man** — The outer ring falls. November's composite unit receives the retreat order and descends from the south wall into the Iron Marches. An Ironclaw warband ambushes the column at an intersection, and a Legionnaire named Brenn goes down with a shattered leg. The column flows past him. November stops.

A sergeant tells him to leave the man. November says one word: *No.*

He gets Brenn upright. Edric comes back — without hesitation, without being asked — and takes the other side. They carry Brenn two hundred paces through smoke and pursuit while the orcs close from behind. November's left arm seizes completely. A thrown stone hits his back. Legs fail. A covering force from the Anvil Gate buys the final seconds. They make it through. The gate closes.

The Creed in action — not as a speech, but as a choice that costs flesh. Edric says "I know" when November explains why he stopped, and in those two words, the boy has internalized the code.

Committed as `d778d1b`.

=== Iteration 20 ===
**Chapter 16 — INSIDE THE WALLS** is complete. Here's the summary:

**POV:** Warlord Thokk Ironhide | **Day 4** | **~3,500 words**

**What happens:**
- Thokk walks through the conquered Iron Marches, reading the aftermath — orc and human dead, evidence of disciplined fighting withdrawal, the smell of a slaughterhouse
- Casualty update: 208 Ironclaw dead total (167 + 41 today), 66 goblins dead, 500 Revenants untouched
- Krogan reports the eastern bastion cleared; Thokk orders 32 human prisoners fed the same ration as his warriors
- Malga's arm wound continues worsening — three days of tearing it open, never mentioned by her
- **The Sundered Gate scene**: Thokk walks the Veil's Throat (60-70 Ironclaw dead from four days of ram assaults), puts his hand on the gate — still warm, wards still pushing back. The gate never fell. "Dwarves built dis." "Nothing stands forever."
- Looks south at the Anvil District wall — shorter, thinner, but the humans are already fortifying. Seven hours since the breach and the commander has reorganized. *Ghar-rukk* — "the wound that builds the wall"
- The recognition/mirror theme reaches its fullest expression: "The difference between them was geography. It had always been geography."
- Gharza confirms Rath's rear-guard action from Ch.15 (four men, twenty minutes, nine Ironclaw killed) — seen from the orc side
- Food crisis: four days left. "Dawn. We go at dawn."
- Evening pyres, Grimtusk reports the spirits are pulling away — "the roots are too thin to hold"
- Closes with: "The dark came in behind him."

**Continuity maintained** with all prior Thokk chapters (Ch.2, 8, 12). All recurring motifs carried forward: the children needed to eat, the skull and cracked wolf knuckle, the number seven, roots in bad soil, the locked room behind his ribs.

**Chapter 17 — THE CRACKING is complete.** Committed as `b94fa96`.

**Phase 5 is now finished** — all four Day 4 chapters (Ch.14-17) are done.

### Chapter Summary

This is Kael Veyne's fourth POV chapter, set on Day 4 as the outer ring falls. The key beats:

1. **The Refugees**: Kael stations himself at the Anvil Gate and blesses over a hundred people flooding through — children, women, wounded, civilians. The Ward of the Threshold repeated until the words lose their substance. A six-year-old girl with a cloth doll stops in front of him, receives his blessing, and walks past unchanged.

2. **The Woman's Question**: A woman with her dying husband on a stretcher asks Kael directly: *"Why does your god allow this?"* He begins the trained answer. She cuts through it: *"Will the counting save him?"* Kael says *"No"* — the raw syllable before the training can intercept. She asks the devastating follow-up: *"Then what are you for?"* He has no answer because the trained answer is hollow and he can hear the hollowness now.

3. **Edric on the Barricade**: Kael sees his nephew thirty paces away at the new defensive line. He calculates the institutional mechanism to pull Edric off — and recognises it as corruption, the very thing the Inquisition hunts. He blesses Edric from across the street instead. The blessing is the only bridge. Edric nods — the boy understands.

4. **The Not-Kneeling**: Kael returns to the Cathedral and for the first time in twenty-eight years, does not kneel. The faith-arc progression: Ch.5 (intact/"yet") → Ch.9 (ground-shift) → Ch.13 (silence troubles him) → Ch.17 (does not kneel). The crack is not in the faith — it's in the container. Sister Reva's polishing has stopped. The ground is moving.

**Next task**: Phase 6, Chapter 18 — The Ghost District (Stoneveil POV, Day 5).
