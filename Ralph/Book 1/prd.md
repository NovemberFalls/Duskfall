## Phase 1 — Pre-Writing Validation

> Before writing a single word of prose, validate that all planning docs are consistent
> and the story spine is solid. These tasks produce no chapter files — they audit and
> update the planning materials.

- [x] **Continuity audit:** Read ALL planning documents (Premise, POV Characters, Character Bible, Writing Rules, Chapter Outline, Key Moments, Worldbuilding Through Action, Foreshadowing). Verify there are no contradictions between documents. Check that November's character bible matches the chapter outline (e.g., the healer's name is "Horus" everywhere, Edric Thane dies during the siege, Skrixx survives). Log any issues found in progress.txt. If issues exist, note them but do NOT fix planning docs — those are the author's territory.
- [x] **Edric Thane character sketch:** Read `01 - POV Characters.md` (Edric section) and the chapter outline. Write a 500-word character sketch for Edric Thane as a secondary character file: `Book 1/Noteworthy/04 - Edric Thane - Secondary Character.md`. Include: his personality, his relationship with November in the composite unit, the moment he wins the reader's heart, and how/when he dies. His death should be devastating — earned through genuine affection, not cheap manipulation. He is 19, the son of a blacksmith whose shop Stoneveil firebombed. He enlisted because the pension wasn't enough. He is Kael Veyne's nephew.
- [x] **Horus character sketch:** Write a 500-word character sketch for the healer Horus: `Book 1/Noteworthy/05 - Horus - The Healer.md`. Include: her personality, how she carries herself, what she means to November, specific details the reader needs to love her in Chapter 1. She is a healer at the Hall of the Fallen, works among war-wounded and war-dead, sees the worst of Bloodhollow and chooses to stitch it back together. She didn't fix November — she showed him that fixing was possible. She goes by Horus.

---

## Phase 2 — Part One: The Gathering Dark (Day 1)

> Day 1 establishes everything. The reader falls in love with what November loves,
> meets the enemy and sees their humanity, understands the tactical reality, experiences
> the blast, and watches faith stand tall before it starts to crack.
>
> KEY MOMENTS in this phase: #1 The Last Good Morning, #2 The Blast

- [x] **Prologue — THE ANVIL:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/00 - Prologue - The Anvil.md`. POV: Stoneveil. Setting: The Anvil District, 6 months before the siege. Stoneveil watches the firebombing of the Black Anvil Revolt. Forge-King Drelgar Blackhand dies standing over his forge. 900 people burn. Stoneveil watches until the screaming stops, then turns to give his next order. Establish: moral weight, grimdark tone, this is not a story with clean heroes. Target: 3,000-4,000 words.
- [x] **Chapter 1 — THE LAST GOOD MORNING:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/01 - The Last Good Morning.md`. POV: November Falls. KEY MOMENT #1. November and Horus share a quiet morning in Emberfall. She tends patients at the Hall of the Fallen. He trains — badly, earnestly. They share a meal. She teases him about his swordwork. He tells her about the Creed. Make the reader fall in love with what November loves. Tender, real, two imperfect people who found each other. No melodrama. Small, specific details. Target: 3,000-5,000 words.
- [x] **Chapter 2 — THE HORIZON DARKENS:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/02 - The Horizon Darkens.md`. POV: Thokk Ironhide. Thokk surveys his army from the hills. 2,500 warriors. Skrixx's goblin siege engines. Grimtusk reads the bones — omens unclear. Thokk commits anyway. Two winters before the hunting grounds fail. This is not a raid. This is war for survival. Humanize the enemy immediately. Orcish voice: blunt, declarative, short muscular sentences. Target: 3,000-4,000 words.
- [x] **Chapter 3 — THE SUNDERED GATE:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/03 - The Sundered Gate.md`. POV: Stoneveil. Stoneveil prepares defenses. Walks the Iron Marches, inspects the gate. Captain Isolde Veyne reports: 850 combat-ready. Stoneveil does the math and says nothing. Lord Commander Blackthorn will not commit reserves. Stoneveil is alone. Establish the tactical gap. Target: 3,000-4,000 words.
- [x] **Chapter 4 — THE FIRST THUNDER:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/04 - The First Thunder.md`. POV: November Falls. KEY MOMENT #2 (The Blast). The siege opens. Goblin siege engines launch. Blast hits near the Hall of the Fallen. November is thrown. Darkness. He wakes in smoke and screaming. Searches for Horus. Shouts her name. Finds nothing. Soldiers run past — he is invisible, a civilian, nobody's priority. The gates close. Sudden, violent, disorienting — the reader should experience the concussive shock alongside November. Target: 3,000-5,000 words.
- [x] **Chapter 5 — THE PRAYER:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/05 - The Prayer.md`. POV: Kael Veyne. Kael performs rites of protection over the garrison. Blesses weapons in the Cathedral of Tyr's Judgment. Calm, armored in faith. Walks the Inner Ring — Ironbound Guard at the Garrison, War-Mages at the Veilfire Spire. Everything ordered. He prays. The silence that answers does not trouble him. Yet. Establish faith as a pillar — show it intact so the reader watches it crack. Target: 3,000-4,000 words.

---

## Phase 3 — Part Two: First Blood (Day 2)

> The first full assault. November's first kill. Thokk counts his dead. Kael's ground
> shifts. Introduce Edric Thane as November's companion in the composite unit.
>
> KEY MOMENTS in this phase: #3 November's First Kill, #7 Thokk's Death Rites (Part 1)

- [x] **Chapter 6 — THE WAVE:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/06 - The Wave.md`. POV: Stoneveil. First full assault. Orcs hit the Sundered Gate and outer wall simultaneously. Stoneveil commands from ramparts. Defenders hold — barely. Casualty reports. Stoneveil adjusts. The machine works. But the numbers are wrong. Target: 3,000-4,000 words.
- [x] **Chapter 7 — THE BORROWED SWORD:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/07 - The Borrowed Sword.md`. POV: November Falls. KEY MOMENT #3 (November's First Kill). November finds a composite unit forming near the gate. Soldiers who've lost their squads. He picks up a dead man's sword. Introduce Edric Thane here — the young Legionnaire who becomes November's companion. November fights for the first time — sloppy, terrified, desperate. He kills. He is hit. He goes down. He gets back up. The kill is clumsy, ugly, not heroic. The weight of a body going limp, the smell, his hands shaking. Target: 4,000-5,000 words.
- [x] **Chapter 8 — THE BONES SPEAK:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/08 - The Bones Speak.md`. POV: Thokk Ironhide. KEY MOMENT #7 Part 1 (Thokk's Death Rites). After the first assault, Thokk counts the dead. More than projected. Skrixx's engines broke through in two places but goblins couldn't hold the breach. Grimtusk reads the bones — spirits restless but unclear. Thokk walks the camp, performs death rites himself. Victory marking, death honoring, spirit thanking. He is not a tyrant. He is a father watching his children die. Solemn, ritual, the grief of a leader burying his people. Target: 3,000-4,000 words.
- [x] **Chapter 9 — THE FIRST RITES:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/09 - The First Rites.md`. POV: Kael Veyne. Wounded flood the Hall of the Fallen. Kael moves between infirmary and walls, administering last rites. A soldier dies with Kael's prayer on his lips. The prayer didn't save him. Kael tells himself this is Tyr's will. The crack hasn't appeared yet. But the ground shifts, slightly. Target: 3,000-4,000 words.

---

## Phase 4 — Part Three: The Grind (Day 3)

> The siege becomes attrition. Stoneveil's cold calculus. November's inner compass.
> Thokk's dwindling resources. Kael's faith meets High Inquisitor Marrow.

- [x] **Chapter 10 — THE MATHEMATICS OF BLOOD:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/10 - The Mathematics of Blood.md`. POV: Stoneveil. Day 3. Relentless assault. Stoneveil manages rotations, repairs, supplies. Triage decisions — who gets medicine, food, who goes back to the wall. Every choice correct. Every choice kills someone. He eats standing up, sword still in hand. Hasn't slept. Target: 3,000-4,000 words.
- [x] **Chapter 11 — THE COMPASS:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/11 - The Compass.md`. POV: November Falls. November checks in with himself — the inner compass. He's bruised, cut, exhausted. The soldiers have accepted him — not as a fighter, but as a presence. He carries water, drags wounded to medics, stands his shift and someone else's (5 hours sleep). Deepen the bond with Edric Thane. Show November being useful in ways that aren't combat. He is useful. That is enough. Target: 3,000-4,000 words.
- [x] **Chapter 12 — THE PRICE OF FEEDING:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/12 - The Price of Feeding.md`. POV: Thokk Ironhide. KEY MOMENT #7 Part 2. Thokk discusses strategy with War-Chiefs. Siege costs more than anticipated. Supplies stretched. Skrixx demands more resources for engines. Thokk balances goblin demands, orc casualties, dwindling timeline. He sees defenders fight with desperation he recognizes — and the recognition unsettles him. Target: 3,000-4,000 words.
- [x] **Chapter 13 — THE SILENCE:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/13 - The Silence.md`. POV: Kael Veyne. Kael prays at the Cathedral. The silence is louder. Watches High Inquisitor Varian Marrow sentence a deserter to death. Marrow's faith is absolute and cruel. Kael sees his own future in that cruelty and recoils. But what is the alternative? Doubt? Target: 3,000-4,000 words.

---

## Phase 5 — Part Four: The Break (Day 4)

> The outer ring falls. The retreat. Thokk walks through the conquered district.
> Kael confronts the refugees. November carries a man who should be left behind.
>
> KEY MOMENT in this phase: #4 The Wounded Man

- [x] **Chapter 14 — THE OUTER RING FALLS:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/14 - The Outer Ring Falls.md`. POV: Stoneveil. Ironclaw breach the outer ring's flanks. Sundered Gate holds but Iron Marches overrun. Stoneveil orders retreat to the Anvil — middle ring. Leaves wounded behind. Does not look back. Correct decision. Worst thing about it. Target: 3,000-4,000 words.
- [x] **Chapter 15 — THE RETREAT:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/15 - The Retreat.md`. POV: November Falls. KEY MOMENT #4 (The Wounded Man). November's unit falls back through Iron Marches. District overrun — orcs flooding breaches, street-to-street fighting. He carries a wounded soldier — heavier than him, slower than the retreat. Someone tells him to leave the man. November does not leave the man. Edric helps. The Creed in action — not as a speech, as a choice. It costs November something (speed, safety, a wound). Target: 4,000-5,000 words.
- [x] **Chapter 16 — INSIDE THE WALLS:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/16 - Inside the Walls.md`. POV: Thokk Ironhide. Thokk walks the conquered outer ring. Orc dead everywhere. Human dead too. Stands in the Sundered Gate — the gate that never fell. Looks inward at the Anvil District. Knows Stoneveil is in there reorganizing. Respects this. Makes what comes next worse. Target: 3,000-4,000 words.
- [x] **Chapter 17 — THE CRACKING:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/17 - The Cracking.md`. POV: Kael Veyne. Outer ring refugees flood the middle ring. Children. Wounded. The dying. Kael blesses them. His blessings do nothing. A woman asks why Tyr allows this. He gives the trained answer. Hears how hollow it sounds. First time he wonders if she's right to ask. Edric appears among the defenders — Kael sees his nephew and wants to pull him off the line but can't. Target: 3,000-4,000 words.

---

## Phase 6 — Part Five: The Anvil (Day 5)

> Street fighting in the ruins Stoneveil firebombed. The symmetry is devastating.
> November faces his impossible choice. Kael's faith fractures when his prayer fails
> to save a child.
>
> KEY MOMENTS: #5 Stoneveil in Blackhand's Forge, #6 November's Dilemma,
>              #8 Kael's Failed Healing

- [x] **Chapter 18 — THE GHOST DISTRICT:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/18 - The Ghost District.md`. POV: Stoneveil. KEY MOMENT #5 (Stoneveil in Blackhand's Forge). Stoneveil establishes defense lines in the Anvil District — the same district he firebombed. The ruins are his barricades now. He uses the burned-out shell of Drelgar Blackhand's forge as a command post. He stands in the exact spot where the Forge-King died. Quiet horror. He recognizes what he's standing in. Says nothing. That silence says everything. Target: 3,000-4,000 words.
- [x] **Chapter 19 — STREET BY STREET:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/19 - Street by Street.md`. POV: November Falls. KEY MOMENT #6 (November's Dilemma). Street fighting in the Anvil. November's unit is fragmented. His sword breaks; picks up another. A trained soldier beside him takes a spear through the throat — November holds him while he dies. Then the DECISION: ahead, defenders being overwhelmed. Behind, civilians trapped in a collapsed building. He cannot do both. NOVEMBER GOES TO THE CIVILIANS — the soldiers knew death was an option; the civilians are innocent bystanders. Show the cost of this choice — the defenders ahead may die because he didn't come. Target: 4,000-5,000 words.
- [ ] **Chapter 20 — THE SPIRITS GROW QUIET:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/20 - The Spirits Grow Quiet.md`. POV: Thokk Ironhide. Thokk presses into the Anvil District. Street fighting is brutal — worse than the walls. Warriors dying in alleys and chokepoints. Grimtusk tells him the spirits have gone quiet. The bones won't speak. Thokk doesn't know if this means victory or doom. He pushes forward because there is no backward. Target: 3,000-4,000 words.
- [ ] **Chapter 21 — THE BREAKING POINT:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/21 - The Breaking Point.md`. POV: Kael Veyne. KEY MOMENT #8 (Kael's Failed Healing). Kael pulled from Cathedral to front lines. Walks through the Anvil — a version of hell scripture never prepared him for. Tries to heal a dying child. His prayer fails. The child dies in his arms. Faith fractures — crack runs deep but hasn't reached the surface. Devastating, quiet. The loudest moment in grimdark is the silent one. Target: 3,000-5,000 words.

---

## Phase 7 — Part Six: The Seventh Strike (Day 6)

> The final day. The last wall. November's magnetic refusal to break. Thokk and
> Stoneveil meet. Seven strikes. Thokk dies standing. The silence after.
> Edric Thane dies. 72 survivors.
>
> KEY MOMENTS: #9 The Seventh Strike, #10 The Search

- [ ] **Chapter 22 — THE LAST WALL:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/22 - The Last Wall.md`. POV: Stoneveil. Dawn, Day 6. Stoneveil counts remaining forces — catastrophic. Sends final report to Blackthorn. No reserves. Addresses survivors. Not a speech — a fact: they hold here or die. No third option. Target: 3,000-4,000 words.
- [ ] **Chapter 23 — THE MAN WHO WOULD NOT LEAVE:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/23 - The Man Who Would Not Leave.md`. POV: November Falls. Final assault begins. November at a barricade with the remnants of his unit. Edric Thane beside him. Orcs pour through. November fights. Is hit. Goes down. Gets back up. Is hit again. Gets back up again. The soldiers around him — better, faster, stronger — follow his lead. Not because he commands. Because in the hell of Day 6, the man who keeps standing becomes magnetic. EDRIC THANE DIES in this chapter — make it matter, make it hurt, make the reader feel the cost. November holds Edric as he dies. The Creed: we do not abandon. Target: 5,000-6,000 words.
- [ ] **Chapter 24 — THE GATE:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/24 - The Gate.md`. POV: Thokk Ironhide. Thokk leads the breach into the middle ring. Final push. He can feel the balance tipping. Warriors surge forward. Thokk at the front — where Warlords belong. Looking for the commander. Looking for the end. Target: 3,000-4,000 words.
- [ ] **Chapter 25 — THE SEVENTH STRIKE:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/25 - The Seventh Strike.md`. POV: Stoneveil. KEY MOMENT #9 (The Seventh Strike). Stoneveil meets Thokk at the breach point. Two exhausted leaders. The fight is not elegant — two men trying to kill each other in the ruins. Seven strikes. On the seventh, Stoneveil's blade finds Thokk's throat. Thokk falls. Dies standing, as the old ways demand. The orc assault breaks — not from defeat, but from the loss of their leader. Warbands fragment. Retreat begins. Exhaustion, finality. Skrixx Blazebinder escapes with surviving goblin forces. Target: 4,000-5,000 words.
- [ ] **Chapter 26 — THE SILENCE AFTER:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/26 - The Silence After.md`. POV: November Falls. KEY MOMENT #10 (The Search). Fighting stops. November stands in the wreckage. 72 survivors. Smoke clears. He searches for Horus — through rubble, the dead, the wounded. She is not among the survivors. Not among the dead. She is gone. November checks the compass. Standing. Alive. Kept the Creed. Did not abandon anyone. But she is gone. Hollowness. The ringing silence after an explosion. The reader should feel November's chest cavity where his heart used to be. Target: 3,000-5,000 words.

---

## Phase 8 — Epilogue

> The aftermath. The conscription. The final question.
>
> KEY MOMENTS: #11 The Conscription, #12 The Silence After (Stoneveil)

- [ ] **Chapter 27 — THE CONSCRIPTION:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/27 - The Conscription.md`. POV: November Falls. KEY MOMENT #11. Days later. Survivors being processed. Military rebuilding. An officer approaches — the civilian who fought for six days without rank or order. November is told, not asked, that he is now a soldier of the Emberfall Legion. He puts on the armor. Takes the oath. Not for the empire — for the reach it gives him. Somewhere, Horus is alive. He has to believe that. If the only road runs through the machine of war, he'll walk it. The Creed survives. November Falls walks forward. Determined, cold. Target: 3,000-4,000 words.
- [ ] **Chapter 28 — THE SKULL:** Write `Book 1/Chapters/28 - The Skull.md`. POV: Stoneveil. Short epilogue. Stoneveil in the wreckage of the Sundered Gate. 72 survivors. Should feel victory. Feels nothing. The Anvil burned twice. Outer ring is rubble. Dead outnumber the living. Looks at his hands — blood that won't wash off. Reports to Blackthorn. The city held. The cost was everything. Final image: Stoneveil alone in the ruins, silence after war, the question he can't answer — was it worth it? Emptiness. The book ends with the sound of wind through ruins. Target: 2,000-3,000 words.

---

## Phase 9 — Polish and Continuity

> After all chapters are drafted, do a continuity pass. Check character consistency,
> timeline, named locations, and emotional beats.

- [ ] **Continuity pass:** Read ALL chapters in order. Check: character names consistent, timeline (6 days) matches, wounds carry forward (if November is cut in Ch 7, he's still cut in Ch 11), named locations match the Emberfall geography, Edric Thane's arc from introduction to death is earned, Horus's name is consistent. Log any continuity errors found in progress.txt. Create a fix list in `Book 1/Noteworthy/06 - Continuity Notes.md`.
- [ ] **Emotional arc verification:** Read all chapters focusing on the 12 Key Moments from `Noteworthy/01 - Key Moments.md`. Verify each key moment lands with the correct tone. Verify the emotional ramp: constriction → weight → moral vertigo → devastation → investment. Log assessment in progress.txt.
- [ ] **Foreshadowing verification:** Read all chapters checking against `Noteworthy/03 - Foreshadowing and Seeds.md`. Verify: Captain Isolde Veyne appears and survives, the elven civil war is mentioned in passing, November's brother is referenced, undead in the north get a mention, Skrixx survives and escapes, the Veilfire Spire glows during battle, Stonehaven gets a passing reference. Log what's planted and what's missing in progress.txt.
- [ ] **Final commit:** Stage all chapter files: `git add "Book 1/Chapters/"`. Commit with message: `feat: complete first draft of The Seventh Strike — Book 1 of Duskfall`. Do NOT push.
