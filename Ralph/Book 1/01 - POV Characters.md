# Book 1 -- The Seventh Strike
## POV Character Breakdowns

---

## POV 1: WARDEN ALRIC STONEVEIL
**Role:** Primary protagonist. The weight-bearer.

### Who He Is
- Age 52. Warden of the Sundered Gate -- the primary entrance to Emberfall.
- A career soldier who earned his rank and title ("The Unyielding Shield") at the Battle of Ashgate Approach (Year 93) where he killed Overseer Brok Drakhold and held the pass with 420 survivors from 1,100 defenders.
- Six months before the siege, he ordered the firebombing of the Anvil District to crush the Black Anvil Revolt. Forge-King Drelgar Blackhand and over 900 rebel smiths died. Stoneveil watched it burn from the walls.
- He is not a cruel man. That is the worst part.

### What He Wants
- To protect Emberfall. That is his oath, his purpose, his identity.
- Privately: absolution for the Anvil. He wants someone to tell him it was necessary. No one does, because everyone knows it was -- and that makes it worse.

### What He Fears
- That the Anvil wasn't an aberration. That it was a preview. That holding the line will always require him to become something worse than what he's fighting.
- That the next time he gives an order like that, he won't feel anything at all.

### His Arc
- **Day 1**: He is the wall. Stoic, competent, commanding. The soldiers trust him because he's survived everything. But there's a hollowness behind the discipline -- the Anvil ate something out of him.
- **Days 2-3**: The siege intensifies. Stoneveil makes the "smart" calls -- collapsing tunnels with miners still inside, ordering wounded soldiers back to the wall, rationing food by military utility rather than need. Each decision is correct. Each decision costs him.
- **Days 4-5**: The outer ring falls. Stoneveil is forced into the kind of street-by-street, building-by-building fighting that echoes the Anvil. The parallels are explicit and agonizing. He begins to wonder if he's defending a city or just running through the same nightmare on repeat.
- **Day 6**: Thokk breaches the middle ring. Stoneveil meets him at the gate. Seven strikes. Thokk dies. Stoneveil stands in the wreckage with 72 survivors and no idea if what he saved was worth what he spent to save it.

### Voice
- Controlled. Measured. Military precision even in his internal monologue. But the cracks show in what he *doesn't* say -- the sentences that stop mid-thought, the memories he pushes away, the way he describes the Anvil fire in exact tactical detail but never mentions the screaming.

## POV 2: NOVEMBER FALLS (SERIES PROTAGONIST)
**Role:** The soul of the series. The civilian who becomes the defender. Our Drizzt.

*See full character bible: 03 - November Falls - Character Bible.md*

### Who He Is
- Age 27. Not a soldier. A civilian with sparse martial training and a moral code that's bigger than he is. Lost his father, mother, and brother to the Veilfire War. Nearly lost himself to the bottle. Was saved by a healer at the Hall of the Fallen -- a woman who saw something in him worth stitching back together. They fell in love. He got sober. He started training. He started becoming.
- Then the siege opened and a goblin siege blast tore them apart.

### What He Wants
- To find her. Everything else is secondary.
- To become the man the Creed describes -- a defender of those who cannot defend themselves. He's not there yet. Not even close. But every day, a little closer.

### What He Fears
- Failure. That he'll never be good enough to save the people who matter.
- Dishonor. That the world will force him to break his code, and he'll discover he's willing to.
- Abandonment. That he'll lose everyone again. That the people he loves are always being taken from him and he's always too weak to stop it.

### His Arc
- **Day 1**: The blast. The separation. He wakes in the rubble, she's gone. The siege closes around him like a fist.
- **Days 2-4**: He volunteers for the defense. Not conscripted -- he chooses. He is thrown into a composite unit and fights alongside trained soldiers who outclass him in every way. He gets hit. He goes down. He gets back up. He is not the best fighter on the wall. He is the one who won't leave it.
- **Days 5-6**: In the ruined Anvil District, his unit shatters. He rallies scattered survivors -- not through rank or skill, but through the brute fact of still being there. His actions don't win the siege, but they hold a position that should have fallen. People who are better than him in every measurable way start following the man who simply won't quit.
- **After**: 72 survivors. The military sees what he did. He is conscripted. He puts on the armor because the only way to find her is through the machine. The Creed survives the siege. November Falls walks out a different man -- not a hero, but a beginning.

### Voice
- Honest. Internal. The voice of a man who talks to himself because he has no one else. His narration runs through the lens of the inner compass -- checking in, measuring himself against the Creed, feeling the gap between who he is and who he wants to be. Less polished than Stoneveil's military precision, less chaotic than a raw recruit. Steady, determined, and deeply human.

## FORMER POV 2 (DEMOTED TO SECONDARY): LEGIONNAIRE EDRIC THANE
**Role:** Moved to secondary character. Still present in the story -- a young Legionnaire in Stoneveil's garrison -- but no longer a POV. His function (reader surrogate, cost of war, young soldier's perspective) is now served by November Falls, who carries the same rawness but with higher stakes (the missing healer) and a longer series arc. Edric can serve as a companion or foil to November within the composite unit.

---

## POV 3: WARLORD THOKK IRONHIDE
**Role:** The enemy who is not a villain. The other side of the wall.

### Who He Is
- Supreme Leader of the Ironclaw Orcs from Bloodtide Bay. Blood-Crowned through the old ways -- three wars won, a legendary kill under his belt, the skull of the previous Warlord hanging from his belt.
- He is not mindless. He is not cruel for cruelty's sake. He is a leader who understands that his people are dying -- not from war, but from the slow crush of diminishing territory, failed hunts, and the creeping rot that the Veilfire War has spread across Bloodhollow.
- The siege of Emberfall is not about glory. It is about survival. If the Ironclaw don't take human territory, they starve within two winters.

### What He Wants
- Land. Resources. A future for the Ironclaw that doesn't end in a slow, whimpering death.
- To be remembered as the Warlord who saved his people, not the one who led them to another pointless raid.

### What He Fears
- That the spirits are silent because they have nothing left to say. That the old ways are dying and strength alone can't save them.
- That he'll take Emberfall and it won't be enough. That the world is breaking faster than anyone can conquer their way out of.

### His Arc
- **Day 1**: Thokk surveys Emberfall's walls from the orc encampment. He consults with Grimtusk da Bonechanter (Head War-Shaman). The omens are unclear. He commits to the siege anyway because there is no alternative.
- **Days 2-3**: The assault grinds. Thokk loses more warriors than projected. Skrixx Blazebinder's goblin siege engines are effective but unreliable. Thokk begins to see that Emberfall's defenders fight with the desperation of people who have nowhere else to go -- and recognizes that desperation as a mirror of his own.
- **Days 4-5**: Thokk presses into the outer ring. Victory feels close, but the cost is staggering. He walks through the aftermath of a battle and counts orc dead. He performs the rites himself -- victory marking, death honoring -- because the shamans are exhausted. The weight of command is crushing him, but he carries it because that is what Warlords do.
- **Day 6**: Thokk breaches the middle ring. He finds Stoneveil waiting. Seven strikes. He dies standing, facing his enemy, the way the old ways demand. His last thought is whether it was enough.

### Voice
- Blunt. Declarative. Orcish cadence -- short, muscular sentences. But beneath the simplicity is a mind that sees clearly and grieves privately. His internal monologue should surprise the reader -- the depth beneath the brutality. Think of the voice from your military docs but turned inward: "Ya only own what ya can hold. And ya only hold what ya can kill to keep." But what if what you're trying to hold is a future?

## POV 4: INQUISITOR ADEPT KAEL VEYNE
**Role:** The true believer confronting the limits of faith. The specialist lens.

### Who He Is
- Age 42. Inquisitor Adept -- mid-rank in the Inquisitorial Path, stationed at the Cathedral of Tyr's Judgment in the Emberheart. Warden of the Warded Archive.
- A devout servant of Tyr who has spent his career rooting out heresy and corruption. He believes -- genuinely, deeply -- that the Emberfall Legion is righteous, that the Veilfire War is a holy struggle, and that suffering in service to order is sacred.
- He is also Edric Thane's uncle. His sister married the blacksmith. The family connection puts him in direct tension with Stoneveil's legacy.

### What He Wants
- To serve Tyr. To maintain order. To believe that the system he serves is just, even when the evidence suggests otherwise.
- To protect his nephew, whom he pulled strings to get assigned to the gate garrison -- believing proximity to the Warden would forge the boy into steel. He is now horrified by what that decision might cost.

### What He Fears
- That Tyr's silence isn't a test. That the gods really are gone, and everything he's built his life on is a comfortable lie propped up by ritual and fear.
- That Stoneveil is right. That ruthlessness is the only virtue that matters in Bloodhollow. That faith is a luxury the world can no longer afford.

### His Arc
- **Day 1**: Kael performs rites of protection over the garrison. He blesses weapons. He sees the siege as Tyr's crucible -- a test of faith and steel. He is calm, certain, armored in belief.
- **Days 2-3**: The wounded flood into the Hall of the Fallen. Kael moves between the infirmary and the walls, administering last rites. His prayers don't heal. His blessings don't protect. Soldiers die with his words on their lips and it changes nothing.
- **Days 4-5**: Kael witnesses Stoneveil's cold calculus up close and is forced to confront the math of triage -- who lives, who dies, who is left behind. He sees Edric on the walls and wants to pull him off the line but can't, because that would be corruption of duty, the very thing he hunts. His faith begins to crack -- not from doubt, but from the realization that faith and survival may be mutually exclusive.
- **Day 6**: In the final assault, Kael must choose: his duty to the Cathedral or his love for his nephew. The choice he makes defines what kind of man walks out of the siege.

### Voice
- Formal. Liturgical. His internal monologue is structured like prayer -- petition, confession, absolution -- but as the siege progresses, the structure breaks down. The prayers become fragmented. The confessions become questions. The absolutions never come.

## SECONDARY CHARACTERS (Non-POV but critical)

### Pyrelord Skrixx Blazebinder
- Goblin siege engineer allied with Thokk. Provides the war machines. Chaotic, brilliant, expendable in Thokk's calculations. Represents the goblin way of war -- innovation through desperation.

### Captain Isolde Veyne
- Ironbound Guard Captain. Stoneveil's most reliable officer. She doesn't appear heavily in this book but is positioned to inherit the command structure for Book 2. Her single combat victory at the Crimson Scar is foreshadowed.

### Lord Commander Aldric Blackthorn
- Present in the Emberheart. Makes strategic decisions but is physically distant from the walls. Stoneveil reports to him but resents the distance. Blackthorn is the man who authorized the Anvil firebombing. He sleeps fine. That tells you everything.

### Grimtusk da Bonechanter
- Head War-Shaman of the Ironclaw. Thokk's spiritual advisor. Reads the bones, speaks to ancestors, and sees the doom coming. His magic is real but fading -- the spirits grow quieter as the Veilfire corruption spreads.

### High Inquisitor Varian Marrow
- Kael's superior. A man whose faith has calcified into cruelty. He represents what Kael could become if faith survives but compassion doesn't.
