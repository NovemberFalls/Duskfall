Blood at the Gate

Smoke sat low over the camp. Not a forge smoke. Cooking. Tallow. Wet hides. The wind pushed it toward the city and it hung, a low band that hid the lower ring of Emberfall but not the teeth of its walls.

Thokk Ironhide stood on a rise of packed earth and stone. He did not kneel. He did not climb towers. He did not need height to see a wall. He could read a wall from the ground. The cuts. The repairs. The rhythm of patrols. The heat haze of the forges inside. The slow pulse of a city that thought it was still safe.

The Sundered Gate sat at the center like a broken jaw. Black iron. Stone ribs. Two towers flanking. Crossbow slits. Scorch marks from old fires.

He knew its shape. He knew its name. He had heard it in old camps from old warlords. They said Emberfall had never fallen. They said the gate could bleed and still stand.

He lifted his chin. He counted the banners. Four on the north tower. Three on the south. Red field with a black anvil. He stared at the base. Not a single open embrasure. The gate was sealed. They had already closed.

“Hard,” he said.

Grimtusk da Bonechanter stepped up beside him. His bones rattled when he walked. He wore a cloak of stitched hides and ribs. The smell of ash and old fat followed him.

“Hard, aye.” Grimtusk squinted at the wall. “Hard don’t mean strong. Sometimes hard just mean it’s already cracked.”

Thokk did not look at him. “Spoke to spirits.”

Grimtusk clicked his teeth. “Spirits got dry mouths. Talkin’ in dust.” He raised his staff. The top was a jawbone. “They say yes. They say no. They say blood.”

Thokk’s hand went to the skull on his belt. The old Warlord’s face had been scraped clean. A clean bone face with empty teeth. He had taken it in the third war. He had kept it to remember what he would become if he ever forgot the cost.

“Blood we got,” Thokk said.

Grimtusk’s eyes slid to the walls. “Walls too. Walls always drink.”

Thokk watched a line of defenders move on the ramparts. They looked small from this distance. A line of ants with metal in their hands. He could not see faces. He could not see fear. He could see the steady pace. Not a panicked crowd. Not a loose mob.

“They trained,” he said.

“Humans,” Grimtusk muttered. “They train. Then they die same as us.”

Thokk grunted. The Bonechanter had said the same before. The old ways said you respect a hard wall. A soft wall made you lazy. A hard wall made you strong or dead.

A horn blew low in the camp behind them. Not the war horn. A gathering call.

Thokk turned. The staging line was already forming. Ironclaw banners low. Spears stacked. Shields strapped. The first wave. He had chosen who went. He had not chosen who would die.

He walked down the slope. The dirt was packed by days of boots and hooves. The ground was black in spots from cook fires and old blood. His stride was steady. He did not rush. The men watched him as he passed, but they did not cheer. They waited. That was better.

A goblin engine crew shouted near the trenches. Skrixx Blazebinder was up on a scaffold, one hand on a lever, the other waving a torch. He was a thin thing, all joints and teeth. His back was hunched from too many hours over gear-wheels and coils.

Skrixx saw Thokk and flashed his grin. “Big iron! Big gate! We break, aye?”

Thokk stopped at the trench lip and looked down. The machine in the pit was a wooden frame with iron bands, a twisted coil of chain and spring. It was the size of a wagon. The sling arm was already locked. A boulder the size of a small beast sat in the cup.

“You got range?” Thokk asked.

Skrixx spat. “We got throw. Range is for bird. We throw. It go. Or it break. Either way, bang.”

Thokk studied the lashings. The goblins had wrapped the arm in fresh rawhide. He could smell it. It was still wet.

“How many shots before it splits?” Thokk asked.

Skrixx scratched his nose with a screwdriver. “Two. Three. Maybe one. If you want safe, you use your fists. You want hole, you use mine.”

Thokk nodded. He had heard this before.

“Your crew ready?” he asked.

Skrixx snapped his fingers. Three goblins lifted a drum of black powder to a secondary device. The goblin machines were a mess of wood, iron, and stolen fire. Dangerous. Effective. Unreliable. But he had no siege tower. He had no months to starve them. He had days.

Skrixx leaned forward. “We throw when you scream.”

“I don’t scream,” Thokk said.

Skrixx’s grin widened. “Then we throw when you look like scream.”

Thokk left him. The war council stood near the line. No table. No tents. Just men and a single map laid on an old shield. It showed the wall and the three rings. Thokk did not waste time with rings now. The first target was the Sundered Gate and the wall flanks.

He knelt by the map. He did not look at it long. He had already burned it into his head.

“First wave,” he said. “Shield line. Spear behind. No rush. You go to the ditches. You build the ramps. You bring the ladders. You hold. You don’t break. The second wave hits behind you, then the third.”

A big warrior with a scarred jaw nodded. “Humans got fire.” He pointed to the map. “Boil. Oil. They pour.”

“They pour,” Thokk said. “You keep your shields up. If your shield burns, you drop it. You don’t stop. You keep moving. You scream if you need to. But you keep moving.”

A younger one, tusks still small, swallowed. “What if we get to gate? We break?”

“We test,” Thokk said. “We learn. We break what can break.” He lifted his hand. “Listen. The first wave does not take the gate. The first wave is not for glory. The first wave is the price to learn. You pay it. I pay it. The Ironclaw pay it.”

Silence. No one flinched. A few looked down. A few clenched their fists.

“Any questions?” he asked.

No questions.

He stood. He went to the front of the first wave. He walked the line. The warriors were packed tight. Horned helms. Hide armor. Iron plates on shoulders and knees. Their shields were round, big as their torsos. They held axes, spears, cleavers. They smelled of sweat and oiled leather.

Thokk stopped in front of a warrior with a braided beard. The braid had a bone bead at its end. The warrior was old. He had fought in the second war with Thokk’s father.

“Grash,” Thokk said.

“Warlord,” Grash said. His voice was low. He did not smile. He did not need to.

“You lead left flank,” Thokk said.

Grash nodded. “We hold.”

Thokk gripped his forearm. “You hold.”

He moved on. At the right flank, he saw a young warrior with new paint on his face. Red streaks. Fresh. The youth was too eager. That was dangerous.

“Name,” Thokk said.

“Ruk,” the youth said. He said it loud.

“Ruk,” Thokk said. “You keep your shield up.”

“Yes, Warlord.”

“You keep your head down.”

“Yes, Warlord.”

“You follow Grash.”

“Yes, Warlord.”

Thokk moved on. He wanted to say more. He wanted to tell the boy to go back and live. He did not. He was not the kind of Warlord who begged his warriors not to die. They already knew the cost. He respected them enough to let them choose it.

A low drum started behind him. It was the call for the first wave. Not the war drum. The slow one. The one that kept feet in time.

Thokk went back to the rise. Grimtusk was there, hands on his staff.

“You should talk to them,” Grimtusk said. “Old words. Old fire.”

Thokk shook his head. “Talk makes them hungry. Hunger makes them rush. I need them steady.”

Grimtusk’s mouth twisted. “Steady get you killed too.”

“Steady gets you to the wall,” Thokk said.

He lifted his hand. A horn sounded once. The drum beat deepened. The first wave began to move.

The line flowed down the slope like a dark river. Shields locked. Spears in rear. They moved at a measured pace. No roar. No rush. Just the thud of feet. The sound of leather. The scrape of iron.

Thokk watched the distance close. He could see the wall better now. He could see defenders along the parapet, moving to their posts. The gatehouse was silent. No horns from the city yet. They had been waiting for this.

A second horn sounded. A different call. The goblins’ call. Skrixx was ready.

Thokk did not look at him yet. He watched his own. The first wave reached the ditch. The humans had dug it wide. He saw the lip, the shadow where it dropped. The orcs halted. They began to fill it. They dragged bundles of wood, heaped straw, broken planks. They threw in the bodies of dead animals they had brought for this.

Arrows started to fall. The first hiss came from the left tower, then the right. The arrows were thick, black fletched. They struck shields and stuck, rattling. A few punched through hide. One hit a warrior’s neck. He went down hard. No scream. Just a drop.

Thokk’s jaw tightened. He did not move.

A second volley came. The orcs raised shields. They moved as they filled the ditch. Slow. Steady. The arrows thudded. A few hit legs. One took a man through the thigh. He fell. Two others hauled him up and pushed him forward.

The distance from the ditch to the wall was open ground. Clay and rock. No cover. Thokk had expected this. He had sent them in heavy shield. He had not sent in berserkers. They would waste their blood.

The goblin machine fired.

The boulder leapt from the sling with a groan of wood. It arced toward the left tower. It hit the stone below the parapet and exploded. Not in fire. In dust and shattered rock. The sound cracked. The wall held. A spray of stone flew. A defender on the parapet fell. He went over the edge like a rag and hit the ground at the base.

Skrixx’s cheer carried in the wind. A chittering sound. The second machine fired. That boulder struck the gatehouse front and split. The iron bands around the gate shivered. No breach.

“Again,” Thokk said.

He did not yell. The order went to the horn. A short blast. The goblins reset. Their crews danced around the machines, quick hands on levers. One goblin slipped and burned his palm on a hot coil. He screamed and kept working.

The first wave reached the wall. The ladders went up. Orcs climbed. The defenders poured boiling oil. The first man on a ladder screamed as it hit his face. He went backward and took three with him. The ladder fell. The wood caught fire.

Thokk watched. He had seen this before. He did not flinch.

The second ladder went up. A spear thrust from above took the first climber in the throat. He grabbed the spear. His blood ran down the shaft. He died clinging to it. The second climber tried to step around him and slipped. The ladder shook. The defenders cut it. It fell.

“Hold the ladders,” Thokk said to no one. “Hold.”

The line at the base stayed. They raised shields over their heads. They protected the ladder men. They did not break. They did not rush. They held.

The third ladder reached the parapet. Two orcs climbed. One made it over. He swung his axe. He took a man’s arm. He roared. A defender stabbed him in the gut. Another hit him with a hammer. He fell back, hand still on the parapet edge. His fingers slipped. He dropped.

Thokk felt the grip of the old Warlord’s skull against his belt. He did not touch it.

The goblin machine fired again. The boulder struck the gatehouse front. A crack ran across the stone. It did not open. The iron bars held.

Skrixx screamed in goblin tongue. A new volley of arrows hit his crews. Two goblins fell. One crawled back to the machine, still dragging a lever. He did not stop. He died with his hand on it.

The humans were good. Better than he wanted. Better than he told himself. Their volleys were timed. Their oil poured at the right moment. Their spears struck in rhythm.

He watched the orcs below. They were taking it. Not fast. But they were taking it.

A horn sounded from the wall. A different tone. The defenders were calling to each other. A gate to the left opened. A small sally team ran out, shields high, and threw fire pots into the ditch. The wood bundles caught. The straw flared. The fire rolled.

Orcs at the edge pulled back. Their shields smoked. A warrior’s cloak caught. He beat at it and kept moving.

Thokk’s eyes narrowed. The humans were using short thrusts. No long push. They were conserving.

“Second wave,” he said.

Another horn blast. The second line began to move. They came faster. Not running, but brisk. They hit the ditch. They pushed more wood. They threw more bodies. They used the first wave as cover to cross the open ground. That was the plan. That was the cost.

Thokk saw Grash on the left flank. He saw the old warrior take an arrow in the shoulder and keep moving. He saw him plant a ladder and hold it. He saw him take a spear thrust to the side. He did not drop.

Ruk was on the right. The boy moved too fast. He climbed with his head up. A bolt struck him under the jaw. He fell. He hit the ditch. He did not move.

Thokk’s throat tightened. He did not look away. He kept watching.

A ladder held. Two orcs reached the top and stayed. They swung axes. The defenders backed. A third orc came up. He leapt onto the parapet. He was cut down in a heartbeat. But for a breath, they had held.

Thokk grunted. He was not pleased. He was not surprised.

Another goblin shot hit the gatehouse. The stone cracked again. He saw a sliver of light between two blocks. Not enough for a breach. Not yet.

“Send the trolls,” someone said behind him.

Thokk did not turn. “No.”

“They can carry the ram,” the warrior pressed.

Thokk shook his head. “Not yet.”

He would not waste the trolls on a wall that still held. He needed them for when the gate cracked. The trolls were slow. They were strong. They were easy to kill on open ground. He would not feed them to arrows.

A soldier ran up, breathing hard. His arm was cut. “Warlord. Grash down.”

Thokk turned to the line. He saw it. A gap on the left. The shields wavered. The defenders poured fire. The orcs at the base pulled back.

“Hold left,” he said.

The runner nodded and sprinted.

Thokk watched the left side collapse. A ladder fell. The men tried to raise another. A spear took the man’s eye. He fell. His shield rolled. The men behind him hesitated. A step. Then another. A break in the line.

“Steady,” Thokk said, low. “Steady.”

He did not shout. He did not need to. The warriors on the left saw him. They saw the Warlord watching. They pushed back into the gap. The line held. Barely.

The assault burned for what felt like an hour. It was less. The drum beat kept time. The arrows thudded. The screams came in pulses. The wall did not move.

He watched the gate. The crack widened a finger. No more.

He saw the defenders’ faces now. Some had soot on their cheeks. Some bled from the brow. None fled. The humans at the gatehouse fought like they had nowhere to go.

Thokk felt something heavy in his gut. He did not name it.

A horn blew from his own line. The signal for pullback. Not a rout. A measured withdrawal.

He raised his hand. He let the sound carry. The first wave began to peel off. The second wave followed. They lifted their wounded. They left their dead.

The defenders sent a volley of arrows into their backs. That was expected. Shields covered. The orcs moved. They did not run.

The first assault ended with the gate still closed.

Thokk went down the slope. He met the first men as they returned. They were fewer. They were burned and bleeding. Their eyes were flat. Some carried parts of ladders. Some carried friends.

Grimtusk was already by the triage line. He chanted low words and pressed bone dust into wounds. It did not heal. It did not stop pain. But it was the old way. It mattered.

Thokk knelt by a warrior on the ground. The man’s chest was open. His breath was a wet rattle. His eyes flicked to Thokk.

“Warlord,” he whispered.

Thokk took his hand. “You held.”

The warrior’s mouth tried to smile. It failed. He died.

Thokk pressed two fingers to the man’s brow. He marked him with a stripe of blood. The old rite. It said: you died with your face to the wall. You are counted.

He stood and moved. Another lay in the dirt. A broken spear had gone through his side. He was young. Thokk didn’t know his name.

He knelt. He pressed blood to the brow. He said the old words under his breath. “Your bones go to the hill. Your name goes to the drum. Your death goes to me.”

He moved to the next.

He did not do this for all. He could not. But he did it for enough. He wanted them to see him do it. Not for praise. For truth.

Grimtusk appeared at his shoulder. “Spirits heard,” he said.

Thokk looked up. “They hear blood.”

Grimtusk’s mouth pulled down. “They hear more now.”

Thokk stood. He walked toward the staging line. The second wave was getting water. The third wave was waiting. The goblins were resetting their machines. Skrixx was yelling at his crew. Two goblins were dead in the dirt. He stepped over them without looking.

Thokk did not feel anger. He did not feel rage. He felt a cold shape settle in his chest. The first assault had failed. The wall still stood. The gate still held.

He lifted his gaze to Emberfall. The smoke above it was thicker now. Some of it was theirs. Some of it was the city’s.

He saw the defenders along the parapet. They had not left. They were still there. They still watched. He respected that.

He turned to Grimtusk. “Spirits still quiet?”

Grimtusk rubbed a bone charm between his fingers. “They say keep cuttin’. They say don’t stop.”

Thokk nodded. “We don’t stop.”

A warrior approached. His beard was singed. He held Grash’s axe. He did not speak. He held it out.

Thokk took it. He ran his thumb along the edge. It was chipped.

“Grash died?” he asked.

The warrior nodded once.

Thokk closed his fist around the axe. He did not cry. He did not roar. He looked at the wall again.

“Tell the line,” he said. “We go again at dark. We change the angle. We push the flanks. We get closer to the gate. We bring the ram.”

The warrior went.

Thokk stayed. He stood in the dirt with Grash’s axe in his hand. The first assault had failed. The siege had started.

He could feel the weight of it now. Not the wall. Not the gate. The weight of time. Days ahead. Costs ahead. The knowledge that the next line of bodies would be deeper.

He did not turn away. He did not step back.

“Emberfall,” he said to himself. He put the axe on his shoulder. “You fight hard. So do we.”

The drums began again, slower now, a steady beat. The sun sank low. The light turned red.

The siege became real.
