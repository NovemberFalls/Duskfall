Before I draft C03, I need two quick clarifications to stay aligned with your canon and pacing.

1. What is the exact POV and scene scope for C03 (who, where, and which day/hour)?
2. Any specific beats you want included or avoided in this chapter?

OV, Scope, Timeline

Title: Blood at the Gate
Primary POV: Warlord Thokk Ironhide
Secondary POV: None
Day: Day 1 — Late afternoon
Timeframe: First organized assault begins

This is the first time we leave the walls.

Location:

Orc encampment

Siege staging line

War council moment

First wave advance toward Sundered Gate

This chapter mirrors C02 from the other side.

2️⃣ Must-Hit Beats
Required

Thokk surveying Emberfall

Brief exchange with Grimtusk da Bonechanter (omens unclear)

Goblin siege engine coordination (Skrixx present briefly)

Thokk acknowledging cost before it happens

First wave charge

Orc casualties

Thokk performing or overseeing rite for fallen warrior

Recognition that Emberfall fights harder than expected

No philosophy monologue.

Depth through action.

Avoid

No cartoon brutality

No villain framing

No “orc savagery” tropes

No human POV bleed

No Stoneveil internal access

No moral speech

Tone: blunt, controlled, inevitable.

End with:
First assault fails to break the gate.

The siege becomes real.
