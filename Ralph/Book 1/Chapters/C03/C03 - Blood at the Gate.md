He stood on the ridge above the siege line and watched the city breathe.

Emberfall was all black iron and smoke. Walls layered like scar tissue. Fires from a hundred forges turned the haze orange. It was a fortress that had eaten its own shadow. The Sundered Gate sat at the center of the lower ring, a blunt wedge of metal and stone. It had killed his people before. It would try again.

Thokk Ironhide set his jaw. He rolled his shoulders until the scars on his back pulled tight. He counted the banners at the wall by shape, not by number. Too far for clean marks. He did not need them. The gate was the truth.

A horn sounded in the lower camp. The first wave was almost ready.

He looked left. Grimtusk was there already, bones in his hands, ash on his brow. The shaman’s eyes were bright and unfocused, as if looking past the ridge.

“Say it,” Thokk said.

Grimtusk held a knucklebone between two thick fingers. He turned it once. It clicked on the rock.

“The spirits are quiet,” he said.

Thokk did not move. “Quiet means what?”

Grimtusk’s mouth twisted. “It means they’re tired.”

Thokk nodded once. He hated answers like that. He hated the silence more. The old ways were still there, or the shaman would be dust in a cage and Thokk would be wearing his necklace. But the voices had grown thin. Thokk felt it in his bones. A leader was supposed to hear the dead and guide the living. Lately it was only the living who spoke.

He lifted his chin toward the gate. “We go anyway.”

“There is no other,” Grimtusk said.

“I know.”

Grimtusk pocketed the bone. He wiped his hand on his cloak and smudged ash on the fabric. “Your mother’s spirit will walk with you.”

Thokk grunted. It was not a prayer, not quite. He let it sit. The dead did not need words.

Below, the camp moved. Ironclaw banners snapped. Spears rose. Shields came up. Goblins swarmed around the siege engines with their greasy hands and sharp smiles. The machines were squat monsters on wheels. A squat ram with a spiked head. A pair of sling-throwers, crude but heavy. A tall tower of wood and iron, lashed together by ropes that would fail if the gods were careless.

Skrixx Blazebinder stood on a cart, arms flailing, mouth open. He was shouting at his crew, but the wind carried only pieces.

“Left—no, you mud-brained—rotate!”

Thokk watched him, then looked away. Goblins were a tool. Useful, unreliable. He had agreed to the alliance because he needed their engines. He kept them at arm’s length because goblins always had a second plan.

He raised his hand. The nearest captain stepped up. “Warlord?”

“First wave,” Thokk said. “Heavy shields. No glory. Hold the line at the gate. Keep the ram moving.”

The captain’s jaw tightened. “If we lose too many—”

“We will,” Thokk said.

The captain bowed and ran.

Thokk turned back to the ridge. He let the view sit in him for a heartbeat. Not because it was pretty. Because a man should know what he was about to spend.

He had counted the dead in his head last night. If the gate held, if the defenders were even half what the scouts claimed, the first wave would break. He would lose more than he liked. He did not have the luxury of liking. The Ironclaw were starving in their valleys. The Veilfire sickness had poisoned the herds and stunted the game. Another winter would kill them. This winter would kill them if the siege failed.

He looked at the gate again. His hand closed around the hilt of his axe.

“Blood at the gate,” he said to no one.

Below, the horn sounded again. This one was deeper.

The first wave began to move.

*

The ground shook under their feet. The line came off the ridge in a steady march, shields forward, spears angled. The armor on their backs was mismatched. Plates taken from old wars. Leather from hunts. Iron torn from carts and reshaped. Thokk walked beside them, not in front. He did not lead a charge from horseback. He led with his boots in the dirt.

He kept his pace slow. The ram team needed space. The goblin engines creaked behind the orc line. Skrixx rode with them, shrieking at his crew.

“Faster! Faster!”

The city loomed. The first arrows fell before they were halfway.

Shields took the brunt. A few arrows slipped low, found the gaps between plates. A grunt, a stumble. No one stopped. The line tightened. The ground changed underfoot from grass to hard-packed dirt to broken stone.

The defenders were quiet. That told him something. A loud wall was a nervous wall. A quiet wall had done this before.

“Steady,” he called.

The orcs moved as a block, a tide with a spine. The ram rolled between them, a log capped with iron teeth. Goblins clung to its sides, squealing, their legs too short for the stride. It was a good machine, as good as goblins could make.

The first volley of siege stones arced overhead, black silhouettes against the smoke. One hit the lower wall, shattered a parapet. Stone dust rose. A cheer from the goblins. Thokk did not join it.

Then the gate was close.

Arrows thickened. A bolt slammed into the face of the orc two steps ahead of Thokk. The iron punched through his cheek and out the back of his skull. He fell without sound. The orc behind him took his place.

Thokk ducked a bolt that thudded into the shoulder of his cloak. He did not break stride. He lifted his shield and pushed.

They reached the killing ground in front of the gate. The defenders had cleared the space to deny cover. It was bare stone, slick with old blood.

“Ram!” Thokk barked.

The crew pushed. The ram swung. The iron head struck the gate. The impact shuddered up Thokk’s legs and into his bones.

They hit again. And again.

The wall above erupted. Rocks, hot tar, and heavy iron spiked balls were thrown down. The first spiked ball took two orcs in the chest and rolled away with their bodies still attached. Tar hissed as it splashed across shields and skin. A goblin screamed. Then another. The ram crew did not stop.

Thokk’s shield took a rock. It cracked the edge and jolted his arm. He snarled and held.

“Keep it moving!” he called.

The defenders appeared over the gate. Rows of helmets, spears angled down. The orc line pressed forward. Spears met spears. Blood fell in thin sheets. The space shrank. The ram swung. The gate held.

A body fell from the wall. It hit the ground hard, bone breaking, and did not rise. He could not tell if it was orc or human. It did not matter. The dead were all the same.

A shout went up. The left flank was faltering.

Thokk turned his head and saw the problem. The goblin tower had been hit. The front wheels were crushed. It leaned, swaying. Goblins scrambled, screeching, trying to right it. The defenders above hurled another rock. It struck the tower’s side. The tower toppled, crushing two goblins and a pair of orcs beneath it.

Skrixx flung his arms, red-faced, eyes wide. His mouth opened. No words made it across the noise.

Thokk swore. The tower was lost. That was expected. The goblins did not build for longevity. They built for speed. Still, it was a cut.

The ram struck the gate again. A crack spidered across the iron bands.

Thokk’s chest tightened. Not yet. Not today. The gate was thicker than he wanted. He had known that.

“Hold!” he shouted. “Hold the line!”

The orcs locked shields. The defenders above shoved spearheads down between the gaps. Thokk saw a young orc take a point through the collarbone. The boy’s eyes met his for a heartbeat. Then the light went out. Thokk’s jaw clenched. The line did not move.

Arrows hammered the shields. Bolts thudded into the ram. The goblin crew squealed and pushed.

“Again!” Thokk said.

The ram hit. The gate shook. No break.

A horn sounded from the wall. The defenders were calling for reserves. That was a good sign. They were stretched. But the first wave was already bleeding out.

Thokk weighed it. He could push the second wave now, in the hope of a break. Or pull back, save strength, and bring the second wave later.

He chose the first. He had to. If he spent nothing today, he would spend everything tomorrow anyway.

“Second wave!” he called. “Bring the ladders!”

The next line surged. Ladders came over the shoulders of orcs. They ran into the killing ground, feet slipping on blood.

The defenders above moved with drilled precision. The first ladder hit the wall. A spear tip pushed it sideways. It slid, fell. A second ladder went up. It stuck. Orcs climbed. The first head crested the edge. It was cut down. Another came. Another fell.

Thokk pushed forward. He felt the weight of the wall pressing back, a living thing. This was not a raid. This was a grinder. He had known that, but knowing was not the same as standing in it.

The ram hit again. The crack in the gate widened. The iron bands creaked.

He saw a shape above. A figure in dark armor, standing back from the edge. A human with a mask, perhaps. The figure raised a hand. The defenders shifted. A volley of bolts came in tight. The ram crew lost two goblins. The third goblin tried to keep it moving. He was small. The ram sagged.

Thokk shoved through the line, grabbed the ram’s side, and pushed. His boots slipped. He dug in and drove. The ram swung with his weight behind it.

The gate did not break.

He tasted iron in his mouth. He had bitten the inside of his cheek.

Another orc went down beside him. The defender’s spear withdrew. Thokk saw the blood, bright and thin. He did not look at the orc’s face. There was no time.

The horn from the wall sounded again. The defenders’ rhythm quickened. The gate was not breaking. The ladders were falling. The first wave was bleeding out. The second wave was soaking in its blood.

Thokk raised his arm.

“Pull back!” he roared.

The call moved down the line. The orcs backed in a rough order, shields high. The defenders threw rocks and bolts, but their pursuit did not come past the gate. The killing ground emptied in slow, stubborn steps.

Thokk kept his back to the gate until the last of his line retreated. He then turned and walked away, shield up, axe low.

The first assault had failed.

*

The ridge was a table of stone stained with old blood. The line gathered there, wounded sprawled where they fell. Some screamed. Most did not. Medics moved among them with crude tools. Water was poured into mouths. Bandages were tightened. A few were too far gone. They were left.

Thokk walked among them. He did not announce himself. He did not need to. The orcs knew his gait. They looked up, saw him, and tried to rise. He pressed a hand to their chests and pushed them back down.

“Stay,” he said.

He crouched beside a fallen warrior with a split helm. The orc’s eyes were open. His mouth was full of blood.

Thokk recognized him. Rark, son of Juma. A good spear. He had eaten with him last night.

“Warlord,” Rark said. It came out as a rasp.

“You fought,” Thokk said.

Rark tried to nod. It was a small motion.

“Good,” Thokk said.

Rark’s eyes fluttered. The light dimmed. He exhaled, long and slow, and did not breathe again.

Thokk set his hand on Rark’s forehead. He closed the eyes. He stood and signaled to the nearest runner.

“Bring the bone bowl,” he said.

The runner left at a sprint.

Grimtusk appeared, moving with his staff in a slow circle. He looked tired.

“Too many?” he asked.

“Too many,” Thokk said.

Grimtusk dipped his head. He was not surprised.

The runner returned with a carved bowl made of pale bone, etched with old war marks. Thokk took it. He walked to the center of the ridge. He lifted the bowl, then knelt.

His voice was low. He did not shout.

“Blood,” he said. “Steel. Earth.”

He poured a little blood from his own cut hand into the bowl. It was a thin stream. It mixed with the dust. He dipped his fingers in and marked the foreheads of the nearest dead. One by one. He did not skip. He did not rush. Each mark was a weight. Each weight was his.

The orcs around him lowered their heads. The goblins watched from a distance, quiet for once.

When he was done, he stood. He wiped his hand on his cloak. He lifted his axe and held it high, blade catching the orange light.

“Rark of the Ironclaw,” he said. “Kulla. Drass. Murd.” He named the dead he knew. He could not name them all, but he did not pretend to. He ended with the old words, the ones his father had used. “You are not forgotten.”

The answer was a low, rough murmur. It was not a cheer. It was a promise.

He turned and looked back at Emberfall. The gate stood. The wall held. The defenders were smaller now, but still there. They were tired. But they were not broken.

He breathed in the smoke. He tasted ash.

“We hit again,” he said.

A captain stepped up, blood on his cheek. “Tomorrow?”

Thokk shook his head. “Night. We do not let them sleep.”

The captain grinned without teeth. “As you say.”

Thokk looked past him. The goblin engines were being pulled back. Skrixx was shrieking. Two goblins dragged a broken wheel. Another hammered at the ram’s side, cursing. Thokk watched them and saw their terror. If the siege failed, the goblins would die too. They knew it.

He looked back at the gate. He did not see the figure in dark armor now. The wall had pulled back. The defenders were re-forming.

He felt the cost in his shoulders, in his back, in the tightness between his ribs. It was not fear. It was weight.

He had expected the gate to be hard. He had expected blood. He had expected the first wave to break. He had not expected the defenders to fight with that kind of quiet. He had not expected the wall to feel like a living thing.

He would have to change the plan. He would have to make the next wave heavier. He would have to send more of his best into the killing ground.

He could do it. He would do it. That was the price of a future.

He walked down the ridge, past the wounded, past the dead, toward the camp.

The first assault had failed. The siege was real now.
