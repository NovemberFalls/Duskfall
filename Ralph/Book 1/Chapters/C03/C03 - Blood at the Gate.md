Blood at the Gate

The hill stank of wet hide and ash. Thokk stood on the rise above the camps, one boot on a broken stone, and looked down on Emberfall. The walls were black. The iron gleamed where the sun hit it and died where smoke clung. High. Thick. Scarred.

He had seen forts before. He had broken some. He had bled in front of others and walked away with a few hundred still breathing. This one would not fall because of a scream or a run. It would fall because he had no other choice.

He could taste the day in his mouth. Smoke from the forge-city. Grease and rust from their own fires. Blood not yet spilled.

A horn barked behind him. Three short calls. Ready.

He did not turn. He watched the wall. He watched the gate.

He watched for movement on the parapet.

There was. Humans in dark plates moved along the top. Short lines. No panic. The gate was shut. They had seen the army. They had shut it anyway.

Thokk heard the crunch of feet on gravel. He did not look.

“Bonechanter,” he said.

Grimtusk came to his shoulder. The old orc had white paint on his jaw and red on his palms. Bone dust clung to his hair. He carried a sack that smelled like smoke and rot. He did not look at the walls. He looked down at the ground by Thokk’s boot and grunted.

“Spirits quiet,” he said. “No talk. Just wind.”

“Wind don’t tell,” Thokk said.

“Nah.” Grimtusk spat. “Bones twist. Same as last night. Bad. Not bad. Just twist.”

“Say it plain.”

Grimtusk lifted his chin, all teeth and bone, and looked at the walls. His eyes were dull. His hand went to his neck where a wolf tooth hung.

“City’s hungry,” he said. “Hungry walls. It eats men. Yours. Theirs. No favor. No whisper. I can’t see past the gate.”

Thokk nodded once.

“Then we cut the gate.”

“Skrixx wants his toys close,” Grimtusk said.

“Skrixx wants his fire where it can chew.” Thokk watched smoke curl from the towers. “He can want. He’ll do it when I say.”

The old orc made a low sound, almost a laugh, with no humor in it. “Goblins don’t wait for ‘say.’”

Thokk turned and looked at Grimtusk. “They wait for fear.”

Grimtusk’s lip pulled back. “Then make him fear.”

Thokk looked back to the walls. The sun slid down and the light bled red across the stone. It made the towers look like fresh cuts. He had no love for light. He had love for time.

He raised his hand. Two fingers.

A runner broke from the line, sprinting down the slope. The horn barked again. The camps shifted.

Below, the army woke like a beast being dragged to its feet. Orcs on the line took up shields. The Ironclaw banners lifted. Red handprints on black leather. Drums began, slow and heavy, not a song. A pulse.

He walked down from the rise. His cloak dragged through dust. He could feel eyes on his back. He let them look. He let them draw the strength they needed from his shape, his size, the way he did not hurry.

At the staging line, the first wave waited in a crouch. Warriors with scarred faces and burn marks along their arms. The young ones were further back. This was a cut meant to bite hard and die hard.

A troll stood in the line, taller than all of them, a slab of muscle with a chain across his chest. His eyes were flat. He breathed through his nose, slow. A goblin perched on his shoulder like a rat on a ox, quick head, quick hands.

Skrixx was already there, in a leather harness blackened by soot. Small. Sharp. His ears twitched every time a drum beat hit the air. He held a charcoal stick and a scrap of hide with marks all over it. Lines and angles. He was mouthing to himself.

Thokk did not like goblins. He did not hate them. He used them. He needed their machines.

“Skrixx,” he said.

The goblin whipped around, eyes bright. “Boss-krag. Big boss. You see it? You see the gate? Big iron, big stone. Big chew. We burn, we break. My crew ready. We need closer, though. The throwers—”

“Not yet,” Thokk said.

Skrixx’s mouth moved in a fast line. “Not yet? But we—” He stopped when Thokk looked at him. The goblin’s spine went straight. “We wait.”

“You throw when I say.”

Skrixx nodded, quick. “We throw when boss says. We throw hard. We throw ugly.”

Thokk stepped past him. The troll’s eyes followed. Thokk put his hand on the troll’s chest, felt the drum of its heart under knotted muscle.

“Hold,” he said.

“Hold,” the troll said, slow and low, as if the word weighed something.

Thokk moved down the line. The first wave had no cheers. They were quiet. They knew what the wall did.

He stopped in front of a warrior with a cracked helm and a fresh scar across the chin. The orc’s eyes were steady. His name was Grom. Thokk had seen him cut a boar in half with a single stroke. He would not see that again.

“First in,” Thokk said.

“First in,” Grom said.

“Hold till the drums stop.”

“Hold.”

Thokk looked at the ranks behind them. The second wave. The third. The goblin machines were dragged into place by teams of oxen and chained trolls. The wooden frames creaked. The buckets of black pitch glistened.

He could feel the army’s hunger. He could feel their fear under it.

He drew in a breath and let it out slow.

“You know the gate,” he said, not loud, but enough. “It holds. It’ll bite. It’ll take. You don’t break. You don’t run.”

No one answered. They did not need to. They had already bled for him. He had already bled for them.

“Take what you can,” he said. “Hold what you take.”

The drums shifted, faster now. Three beats. Pause. Three beats. The signal.

He raised his fist.

It came down.

The horns cried out. The first wave surged.

They moved as one black mass across the plain. Shields up. Axes low. The ground shook. Thokk walked with them for ten paces, then stopped. His place was not the line. His place was the eye.

He watched.

The distance from camp to wall was open, no trees, no rocks. Emberfall’s defenders had burned the scrub. They wanted clean lines for arrows and fire.

The first volley came from the walls. It was not a storm. It was a measured line. Bolts. Heavy, thick. They punched through shields and men.

An orc fell. Another. A shield split. Blood sprayed out in a thin line. The wave did not slow. It thickened where men fell. It flowed around them.

More bolts. The wall’s rhythm steady. It was not fear fire. It was control.

The first wave hit the ditch. They dropped planks. The first orc to step on the plank took a bolt in the neck. He fell in the water, red blooming. The next stepped over him.

Thokk saw a warrior slip, go down on one knee, and be trampled. The wave moved.

They reached the base of the wall. The ladders went up. Hooks bit into stone. Hands and boots found rungs.

The defenders pushed them off. Long poles. Blades at the ends. Orcs fell backward. They hit the ditch, broke. Others climbed over their bodies.

Thokk watched the gate.

Stone and iron. A seam. A mouth.

The battering ram rolled up, iron head shaped like a boar. It swung and hit. The sound was deep, hollow. The gate did not move.

The ram hit again.

The gate held.

The first wave was on the ladders. Some made it up. A handful. He saw one orc get to the top and take a sword through his belly. He hung there, hands on the parapet, then slid down.

He watched the timing. The wall fire stayed even. The defenders did not overreach. They were trained.

His jaw tightened.

A goblin shriek cut across the field as a wall bolt took him in the leg. He spun, went down, crawling, still dragging a rope tied to a siege ladder. His crew hauled him back as best they could. He screamed the whole way.

Skrixx’s machines were still, per his order. The goblins fidgeted around them, fingers on levers. Impatient.

The ram hit again. The gate shook. No crack.

The drums stayed steady.

Then the wall’s sound changed. Not louder. Sharper. The hiss of burning oil.

A bucket tipped from the parapet. It fell in a thick black sheet and struck the base of a ladder. Flames roared up. Orcs on it screamed and flung themselves backward. One fell, on fire, into the ditch. The fire spread on the water, crawling.

Thokk clenched his hand. He wanted to shout. He did not. The first wave knew it would burn. That was the cost.

He kept his eyes on the gate and the top of the wall, the pressure points. His mind counted. Ladders. Men. Gaps.

A horn from the wall. A change in the defenders. They were rotating. The defenders were not panicking. They were relieving men. That meant reserves. That meant order.

He moved to the right, closer to the machines, to see the left flank. The orcs there had reached the base and were wedging iron spikes between stones. Trying to pull out blocks, to open a hole, to make a pocket.

A human with a red crest leaned over the parapet and pointed. Three archers shifted and put bolts through the first orc’s face. He fell with the spikes still in his hands.

Thokk’s lips pressed into a line.

This was not a wall that had seen one war. This was a wall that had seen many.

He raised his hand and made a low circle. The signal to the second wave to tighten and to the goblins to bring up the machines.

Skrixx scuttled over, eyes bright, hair spiking from his head. “Now? Now? We burn now?”

“Now,” Thokk said.

Skrixx barked at his crew in that fast, broken tongue. The goblins moved like spiders around the frames. They heaved and braced. They lit the pots of pitch.

The first engine threw. The pot arced, a black fat thing, and burst against the wall. Fire blossomed. It stuck to stone and to the men. A human screamed. Another slapped at his arm. He did not get it off. He fell backward.

The second engine threw. The pot hit the parapet and spilled down, a curtain of flame. Orcs at the base yelled, a guttural roar, and pushed ladders up into the smoke.

Thokk watched the gate. The ram swung again. A faint crack. Not the gate. The frame. The iron bands strained.

He could feel the pull in his chest. If the gate broke now, if the wave got in, he could push, could wedge a wedge of iron in and hold it. That was the whole plan. Break, hold, pour in.

He waited.

The defenders did not falter. A line of humans in black moved to the gate. They put shoulders to the inner brace. The ram hit and the gate flexed, but did not give.

Thokk watched the top of the wall. The fire from the goblins was forcing the defenders back. Not far. They were using wet hides to beat at the flame. They were not screaming. They were working.

He saw something else then. A shape in heavy armor, moving along the parapet, not running, not shouting. He didn’t know the man. He did not need to. That was command. That was a leader on the wall. The line’s spine.

Thokk’s throat tightened. Leaders on walls die. Good leaders know when to step away. This one was still there.

The first wave hit their limit. Ladders snapped under the weight, burning. Orcs fell, some into the fire, some into the ditch. The ground at the base of the wall was slick with blood and mud.

The ram’s ropes frayed from heat. One snapped. The ram swung wild and hit the ground. The crew cursed and tried to reset. The gate stayed closed.

He lifted his hand again. Two fingers. The signal to pull the first wave back to the line and let the second step forward.

They did not pull.

Not all. Some were locked at the wall. Some could not move back. The ladders were too hot. The ditch was too filled. The line had no clean retreat.

He could hear their breath even from here. He could hear the change in the drums as the beat stumbled.

He snarled.

“Runner,” he said.

A young orc with a shaved head and a black stripe down his face came to his side. Thokk grabbed his shoulder and pushed him forward. “Tell Grom. Fall back. New wave in.”

The runner sprinted.

Thokk watched him go. The boy dodged a falling ladder. He slid in mud. He got up and ran on. That is what they did. That is what they had to do.

The second wave surged, but it was not clean. It was a shove into a knot. It was bodies at the base of a wall, burning and bleeding.

He moved forward, close enough to see the faces. He would not be a leader who only watched. He would not be one who stayed clean.

A bolt hissed past him and thudded into the ground. Another grazed his shoulder, hot and sharp. He felt the sting, then the blood. He did not flinch.

Grom was at the base, shouting. The helm was gone. His face was dark with soot and red streaks.

“Pull back!” Thokk roared.

Grom looked up, eyes wide. He nodded once and shoved an orc off the ladder, not to kill him but to make room to get down. He grabbed the man’s collar, yanked him back, then slid down the rung himself. A bolt took him in the side. He grunted and kept moving.

Thokk caught him at the bottom. He held him upright for a beat.

“Hold,” Thokk said.

Grom’s mouth opened, closed. He nodded.

Thokk pushed him back toward the line. “Go.”

Grom went.

The second wave pressed in. They took the ram rope and reset it. The ram swung. The gate shook. The inner brace held.

Thokk saw the line on the parapet shift again. A new set of shields. Fresh men. The defense had depth.

The first wave was thin now. Thokk could count the gaps where men had started and were now gone.

He clenched his jaw until it hurt. He had expected loss. He had not expected how clean their line was.

He called to Skrixx, “More fire.”

Skrixx squealed and shoved his crew. The engines threw again. The fire licked the parapet. The defenders retreated a step, then came back. They did not yield the wall.

Thokk watched the gate.

It did not break.

He lifted his hand. The signal to fall back. Three slow beats on the drum. A call to pull in and count. No shame. No panic. This was only the first bite.

The horns blew. The orcs at the base began to pull back. Some were slow. Some were dragging wounded. The defenders on the wall threw down a last volley. The bolts punched into backs. Men fell. Others kept dragging.

Thokk moved forward into the falling line. He grabbed a wounded orc by the arm, hauled him up.

“Keep moving,” he said.

The wounded orc’s eyes were glass. He coughed and stumbled. Thokk pushed him on.

They pulled back to the staging line. The field between was littered with bodies. Orc and goblin. A few humans, too, thrown from the wall by the goblin fire. Not many.

Thokk’s chest was tight. He could feel the heat of the day and the heat of the dead.

He turned to the line and lifted his hand. The drums stopped.

Silence came in.

The orcs breathed. Some laughed, short, the way you do when you’re glad you’re not dead. Some sat down and stared at their hands.

Thokk walked the line. He looked at each face. He said nothing. He did not need to. They could see the wall. They could see the gate still shut. They knew.

A cry rose from the right. A small group was gathered around a fallen warrior. The man’s chest had been split by a bolt. His hands were open, empty.

Thokk went to him and knelt. He set his hand on the dead man’s brow.

“What’s his name?” he asked.

“Rulk,” a warrior said. “He fought at Bloodtide.”

Thokk nodded. Rulk. He had seen him once. Not enough to know him. Enough to feel the loss.

He pulled the dead man’s axe from the mud. He placed it on the man’s chest. He touched his own forehead, then the dead man’s.

“Go to the old fire,” he said. “Take your kills with you.”

He reached into his belt and drew a small strip of red cloth. He tied it around the dead man’s wrist. The rite was simple. It had to be. There were too many.

He stood. He looked at the others. “His blood feeds the clan,” he said.

The warriors echoed it, low. “Blood feeds.”

He moved on. Another dead. Another rite. Another name.

It was slow work. It steadied his chest.

Behind him, the goblins chattered. Skrixx was yelling at his crew, kicking at a jammed wheel, cursing in his sharp tongue. Thokk let him. The goblins needed their noise. The orcs needed his quiet.

When the line was counted and the dead were marked, he went back to the rise.

Grimtusk was there, leaning on his staff, bones clacking.

“How bad?” the Bonechanter asked.

“Bad,” Thokk said. “Not enough.”

Grimtusk’s eyes were on the walls. “City’s strong.”

“They’re trained.”

“Ghosts on the wall,” Grimtusk said. “Old blood. Old stone. It holds.”

Thokk looked down at Emberfall. The smoke from the goblin fire still curled, but the wall was quiet now. No movement. No cheers. No panic. The gate was shut. It was still shut.

He could see his dead on the field. Dark shapes on gray dirt. The wall had not given them back.

He felt the weight in his gut, heavy and familiar.

“Tomorrow,” he said.

Grimtusk nodded.

Thokk stayed on the rise until the sun touched the line of the wall. The light turned red and then went out. The first assault had failed to break the gate.

The siege was real now.
