The first impact found Stoneveil already on the steps.

He'd been moving before the horn sounded — not because he'd known, but because the forge smoke had changed three minutes before it. A man spent thirty years reading fire and he learned to read what fire did to air, to pressure, to the quality of quiet before violence arrived. The smoke over the lower ring had thickened in a way that natural burn didn't account for. He'd been walking toward the rampart stairs when the horn behind him split open the morning.

He took the steps two at a time, not running. Close.

The Sundered Gate's upper walkway was sixty feet above the street level of the outer ring. From there, on a clear day, you could see the tree line at the Veil's Throat and the dark smear of the northern wastes beyond. Today was not a clear day. Today the smoke was wrong in all directions. Stoneveil reached the rampart and put both hands on the stone and looked south.

The column was rising from the lower ring. Not forge smoke. Not cook-smoke. The wrong color, the wrong width, the wrong way it caught the wind and didn't release. He'd seen that color before.

Three hundred and forty meters — no, closer to three-twenty — the first strike had landed in the lower district. He could tell from the dispersion, from the angle of the column, from the way the heat shimmer moved above the roofline. The Hall of the Fallen sat approximately—

He stopped the thought. It wasn't useful yet.

"Bracer," he said, and the sergeant beside him was already holding the signaling cylinder. Stoneveil pulled it open. "Send the red-and-two to the Eighth Corridor. Gate lockdown. Tell Veyne I want her on the east wall in ten minutes. Not eleven."

"Sir."

"Horn relay — three long for full siege protocol. Not two. Three." He was already moving along the walkway, not waiting for confirmation. You didn't wait in siege protocol. You gave the order and trusted the men. If you didn't trust your men, you fixed that before the siege.

Sergeant Bracer's voice carried the relay command behind him, crisp enough to cut. The horn answered from the gate tower, one preliminary note, and then the sequence: low, long, long, long. Three beats. The sound ran down the inner ring like something bleeding out.

Stoneveil kept moving. The rampart ran the full span of the Sundered Gate's upper face, two hundred yards of black stone with crenellations worn smooth by decades of armored hands. He passed two archers at their posts, both watching the smoke column. He did not look at them. They were doing their jobs.

"Healer Renn," he said as he passed the first alcove. A young woman in a half-duty sash turned. "Move the trauma station from the main corridor to the secondary vault. If there's a second strike in the gate complex, I don't want the injured in the same blast radius as the entrance."

She opened her mouth.

"Now," he said, before she could ask why.

She went. He kept going.

The east tower was where he needed to be. From there he'd have the full sight line across the Iron Marches and the kill zone beyond. He turned the corner at the tower base and found two men in militia colors arguing about something he didn't catch. He stopped walking. He put one hand flat against the wall, touching neither of them, and the argument stopped on its own.

"On the wall," he said. "Both of you."

They went.

He climbed the tower stairs at a controlled pace. The air got colder and sharper and smelled more like open sky and iron. When he reached the top platform, he could see everything.

The Iron Marches spread below — the wide, open approach between the Sundered Gate's outer walls and the city proper. They were empty now, civilians having cleared them in the first horn response. Good. The gate seals would be down in three minutes. He could see the movement at the base of the gate structure, three soldiers working the locking chain.

Beyond the outer walls, the Veil's Throat.

And beyond that.

Stoneveil looked at it for a long moment without speaking. The land beyond the outer walls was a wide, flat bowl that dipped toward the tree line. In peacetime it held the market fields — the seasonal camps of traders and hay farmers and the wandering tinkers who ran the eastern routes. Now it held something else.

He didn't make a sound. He wasn't the kind of man who made sounds at what he saw. But he counted, automatically, the way he always counted, because numbers were the only language that didn't lie.

Banners. He could count the banners from here, the Ironclaw's crude black-and-red standards planted at intervals through the tree line. He stopped at forty-one. Not because there weren't more. Because he had enough information.

The horde was arranged in loose blocks that would coalesce under command. He could see the shape of it from here, the mass that moved in the tree line, the closer advance elements already in the kill zone. The goblins — smaller figures, quick in the way of things that lived on speed instead of strength — were working at something in the middle distance. From this height and angle he couldn't see precisely what.

He reached back without looking. "Lens."

The scout behind him pressed a brass spyglass into his palm. He raised it and brought the middle distance into focus.

Goblin crews. Three he could see, probably five if they'd staged well. Working siege engines that hadn't cleared the tree line yet — catapult frames, the arm-and-throw style the goblins favored. Quick to assemble, inaccurate without calibration, devastating once they found range. The nearest crew was adjusting something on the throw arm. Recalibrating. Between salvos.

He'd timed the next strike in his head since the first one landed. He counted forward. Six minutes, maybe seven. That was how long he had before they'd be ready again.

He lowered the lens.

"Garrison strength," he said to the scout.

"Six hundred and twelve effectives as of morning muster, sir. That's before any—"

"Civilian volunteers?"

"Intake was still processing when the horn sounded. Maybe forty, maybe sixty."

"Bring me Sergeant-Major Darro in four minutes."

The scout left. Stoneveil stayed where he was, working the numbers.

Eight hundred fifty, give or take. That was what he had. Against what was across that treeline — he didn't have a precise count. You never did at the start. But the math of the banners and the breadth of the encampment told him enough. This was not a raiding party. This was not a probing assault designed to test the wall and retreat. The goblin siege engines were the first confirmation. You didn't haul catapult frames through forest if you planned to run.

The Ironclaw had come to stay.

The horn relay answered from the south tower, then from the east — three long beats returning like an echo — and he felt the gate begin to answer. The deep, grinding sound of the locking mechanisms engaging. Two hundred years of iron and grease, and the Sundered Gate didn't sound like metal. It sounded like the city deciding to breathe differently.

A runner arrived at the base of the tower stairs and called up. "Warden. Message from the Inner Ring."

"Read it."

"Lord Commander Blackthorn requests—" A pause, probably checking the wording. "Requests a situation assessment at your earliest convenience."

Stoneveil turned from the view. He looked at the young runner, who was eighteen at most. He said, "Tell the Lord Commander that we are currently under siege protocol following a confirmed strike in the lower district, and that I will send written assessment at the four-hour mark. Tell him the word from my mouth."

"Yes, sir. Do you want to — should I say anything about —"

"Word for word," Stoneveil said. "You can manage it."

The runner went. He turned back to the field.

The field report found him a few minutes later, carried by a relay sergeant whose voice was steady enough to mean it was bad but not catastrophic. Strike confirmed in the lower district. The Hall of the Fallen, or the district adjacent. Casualty estimates unavailable. The impact zone was still burning and no assessment team had reached it.

Stoneveil let the information settle without moving. He was looking at the field when the man spoke, and he kept looking at the field when the man finished. He stood there for the space of two breaths. The smoke column was still visible from here, rising south and east. The wrong color. The wrong width.

Then: "Send an assessment team when the gate is sealed. Not before. Priority is the perimeter."

"Sir."

The word sat wrong in his chest, the way it always did when you filed a thing under *later* and couldn't think about what later meant for the people already there. He did not reach for it again.

He was thinking about the approach. About the goblin crews and their calibration timeline. About the two tunnel access points below the Iron Marches that his engineer had been reinforcing for two weeks. About the garrison distribution and whether Veyne had heard the horn or whether he needed to send a second relay.

The gate finished locking. He heard it — the final clunk, the sound of the last pin seating — and something in the air changed. The city was closed. Whatever was outside was outside. Whatever was inside was inside.

Below, he heard the civilian side of that truth a moment later. Shouting from the inner approach road. He went to the inner-side crenellation and looked down.

A supply cart had stalled in the gate corridor — the last forty feet of the approach, still inside the arch. The cart itself was tangled, a wheel caught in a rut, the driver down in the dirt trying to work it loose. But that wasn't the problem. The problem was the people behind it. Twenty, maybe thirty civilians who had made it to the gate in the horn response and arrived forty seconds too late, now pressed against the outer face of the Sundered Gate, the portcullis between them and safety.

He counted quickly. One cart, one driver, a confused knot of people in the gate arch. Beyond them, the outer approach. Beyond that, open field. Exposed.

He recognized the problem before anyone said it aloud.

One of the gate guards below looked up and called, "Warden, the gate —"

"I see it." He was already reading the geometry. The cart was in the arch. The portcullis was down on both ends. The cart's position was blocking the inner lock mechanism from reseating properly — not entirely, not yet, but the stress point was visible if you knew where to look. The cart needed to move.

He looked at the people pressed at the outer portcullis.

The crowd was not quiet. They were pushing, calling out, hands through the iron bars. He could hear the voices as a mass sound, not as individuals, until he looked closely and one of them resolved.

A woman near the front of the press. Red braid, the kind that had faded from full red to something sun-mixed. She was not screaming. She had both hands on the portcullis bars and she was watching him on the rampart with an expression that was not panic. It was something worse than panic. It was a woman who understood what she was seeing and had chosen to look at him anyway.

He knew her. Not by name, or — no. He knew her from the lower ring. Forge row, the bucket lines they ran to keep the workshops from burning during dry season. She had a two-handled pail she moved faster than anyone else on the line. He'd walked past that line once and nodded at the workers. She had nodded back.

He did not know her name. He wanted her to not have a face. She had one.

He looked at the cart. He looked at the gate lock mechanism. He looked at the timeline in his head — six minutes, now probably four — before the goblin crews finished their calibration. He looked at the open approach behind the crowd, at the treeline where the horde waited.

He went to the inner rampart and found the gate corporal below him. He didn't shout. He said it at a volume that was enough and no more.

"Clear the arch. Burn the cart."

A pause below. The corporal looked up. He was a solid man, twenty-year veteran, and he had the decency to look at what Stoneveil was asking before he answered.

"Sir. The cart —"

"Burn it." He held the corporal's gaze. "The lock needs to seat. The arch needs to clear. Do it."

The corporal didn't move for two seconds. It was enough. Stoneveil looked down at him without expression and without hurry, and the silence was not comfortable, and the corporal turned and gave the order to his men.

Stoneveil looked at the field. He did not look at the gate.

He heard the oil splash. He heard the crackle when it caught. He heard the cart go up — fast, the way dry wood with oil went — and the driver, who'd gotten clear, cursing in words that came through even at this height. He heard the shouts from the outer press change register.

He kept his eyes on the field.

The smoke from the cart was different from the smoke to the south. Close-range burning, clean wood and oil, the kind of smell that snapped the mind backward against its will. He pulled in a breath through his teeth and the smell was hot iron and char and for a half-second the sky above him was wrong, it was the sky above the Anvil District, it was six months ago, and below him were buildings instead of a cart and the sound was not one fire but a thousand and—

He closed his eyes. Opened them.

The field. The orc banners in the treeline. The goblin crews at their engines.

He counted the banners again from where he'd stopped. Found four more on the western edge of the deployment. Forty-five total. That was useful. He noted it.

The smell of the cart was already fading, replaced by the smoke from the lower ring, which was persistent. He catalogued both and let them be.

Behind him, the corporal reported the gate lock had seated fully. The arch was clear.

Stoneveil turned from the outer view and walked the length of the rampart to the command corridor entrance. The stairs down were narrow and damp, the stone cold enough to feel through his gloves. He descended at the same pace he'd climbed — controlled, unhurried — because the men would see him and the way he moved was information.

The inner corridor was organized now into something that looked like order if you didn't know what order was supposed to look like. He walked through it and touched Torven's elbow — one of Veyne's section leaders — and steered him two steps left without speaking, repositioning him for better sight lines down the corridor's length. Torven adjusted and kept his eyes forward and said nothing. He knew. Three years together.

Darro was waiting at the secondary vault door, thick arms crossed, soot already on his forearms from somewhere. The engineer had a face built for bad news — wide, patient, the kind of face that didn't shift when you told it things.

"The tunnels," Stoneveil said.

"Reinforcement teams are in position. The third access point under the eastern approach is the weak one. I want two more hours on it."

"You have ninety minutes."

Darro uncrossed his arms. "Warden, I—"

"What you need and what you have aren't the same thing." He said it without heat. "Allocate where the math says. You know how to do it."

Darro looked at him for a moment with the expression of a man doing arithmetic in his head that he already knew the answer to. Then: "I'll need to pull a team from the secondary."

"Pull them."

He went.

A runner arrived with the first written field report. Stoneveil opened it and read it at a walking pace, keeping his feet moving. Strike confirmed in the lower district, structural damage to the Hall of the Fallen approach, fire teams unable to respond due to gate lockdown, civilian casualties unknown. He handed the report back to the runner, who looked at him like he expected something in return.

"File it," Stoneveil said. "Tell the assessment team to bring me a full report at the four-hour mark, not before. And tell them not to put my name on any civilian casualty communication yet. We don't have numbers."

The runner went.

He came back to the rampart by the eastern access and climbed again, this time to the lower observation tier, which gave him a wider horizontal view without the height. From here he could see the full sweep of the approach without the angle compression the tower introduced.

The horde had moved forward.

It was the advance elements — not a charge, not a formation, but a purposeful shift. The orc warband nearest the field center had come out of the treeline cover and was visible now in the open. Too many to count precisely from this range. The goblins had not moved their siege equipment yet, which meant they hadn't finished calibration. He still had time, probably.

The warband in the field wasn't running. They were walking. A deliberate pace, the kind that said they weren't worried about whether the walls were manned. They assumed the walls were manned. They were moving anyway.

Captain Veyne arrived behind him, boots on stone announcing her at the last three steps. She came to stand at his shoulder without being asked and looked at the field.

"Southeast block," she said. "That's a discipline march."

"Yes."

"They're not probing."

"No."

A beat. He heard her take a breath that wasn't quite steady and let it go.

"How many," she said. Not a question.

"Unknown. More than the banners suggest. Western deployment extends past the old Rethwick waystation." He moved his hand along the treeline. "We won't see the full count until they commit."

Veyne said nothing. She was reading what he was reading. She was good at that.

"The east wall," he said. "Alternating split shifts. No one on the wall for more than four hours. If they're staged for a long approach, we burn the men in the first day if we hold them at attention through it."

"I'll need to rearrange the Third and Sixth."

"Do it."

She didn't move immediately. He felt her presence beside him the way you felt a wall you'd leaned against long enough — solid, reliable, known.

"The lower ring," she said carefully.

He kept his eyes on the field. "What about it."

"The Hall. There were people. The civilian workers, the healers —"

"I know."

She stopped. She was reading his posture the way he'd read the field. She had the sense not to ask what he was going to do about it, because she already knew what he was going to do about it, and saying it aloud helped neither of them.

"Four hours," he said. "Assessment team goes in at four hours."

Veyne nodded once, sharp. She left without ceremony.

The orc warband was still walking. In the gray afternoon light they were fully visible — a mass of shapes moving in the rough formation that the Ironclaw used, clusters by kin-group rather than military structure, each cluster tight around a fighter with a banner or a bone-hung standard. He could see the bone standards clearly now — shamanic, war-shaman presence. Ritual preparation. Which meant they'd been planning this long enough to involve the spirit rites. Weeks, maybe months. The strike on the Hall of the Fallen had not been a lucky ranging shot. Someone had been watching this city. Someone had walked the approach routes and clocked the sight lines from the siege engine positions.

He filed it. He would need it later.

The sun had shifted enough to tell him it was past midday — the light came from the southwest now, flat and pale through the smoke. He'd been on the rampart for roughly an hour. He felt it in his knees the way he always felt extended standing, a dull heat behind the joints. Easy to ignore. Useful as a time signal.

Below, the gate corridor had cleared. The cart's remains were a dark smear and a thin curl of smoke, nearly gone now. The inner approach was clean. The lock was seated.

A soldier approached with a water skin and held it out. Stoneveil took it, drank twice, handed it back. The soldier stepped away without a word. He knew better than to hover.

The orc advance was slowing now, settling into position at the edge of arrow range. Testing. They were seeing if the walls would react, if the defenders would spend ammunition on shapes at the limit of effectiveness. He would not. His archers had orders to hold until call.

The goblins were at their engines again. One of the catapults had cleared the treeline, being dragged by what looked like six crews working in coordinated chaos — frantic and purposeful at once, every motion wrong until suddenly the thing was exactly where it needed to be. They were good. He had to give them that.

The engines would be ranged within the hour. Maybe less. That changed the window.

He needed Darro's underground timeline revised. He needed the east wall archers briefed on the engine positions. He needed the field report from the secondary vault and an updated civilian count from the inner ring administration. He was composing the order sequence in his head when the wind shifted.

It came from the south, brief, cold, carrying the smoke from the lower ring directly into his face. The smell hit him before he could stop it — burning timber, the specific sweet-rotten quality of old wood going up fast, and beneath it something underneath that wasn't wood. That was older.

Six months ago that smell had lasted three days. He'd stood on this wall and watched the Anvil District burn and the smell had gotten into everything — his uniform, the stone of the rampart, the inside of his mouth when he ate. He'd given the order and then he'd stood here and watched it execute. Drelgar Blackhand had died in the first ten minutes. The rest had taken longer. He had not looked away then either.

He put it back. Not down — he had learned you couldn't put it down — but back. Behind the information he needed. Filed with things he would think about when there was time for thinking.

The field called him back. The orc warband was settling into what looked like a forward camp position at the range limit — not sitting, not relaxed, but organized. They were establishing presence. The siege engines, once in range, would begin the next phase.

He heard boots on the rampart stairs and turned to find Darro's second, a young woman named Carris who carried the engineer's chalk board.

"Tunnel three," she said, breathing hard from the stairs. "Darro says forty minutes, not ninety. They worked faster."

"Good." He looked at the board. The chalk lines showed the tunnel access points from above, the reinforcement status, the load projections. "What's the stress rating on the secondary brace?"

"Darro said not to tell you that."

Stoneveil looked at her. She was perhaps twenty-two and she did not look away.

"Tell him I need the number," he said. "Not his assessment of what the number means. The number."

She went.

He turned back to the field. The advance elements were fully established now, and he could see the movement behind them — the larger body of the horde shifting in the treeline, reorienting, the way a fist tightened before it committed.

In the kill zone beyond the outer wall, two figures had separated from the edge of the orc formation and were walking the perimeter at the limit of bow range. Moving slowly. Studying the wall. He raised the lens and found them — one orc, broad as a building, moving with a deliberate economy that spoke to someone who had done this before. The other was smaller, faster, keeping two steps behind. Not scouts. Something above scouts. Leadership, maybe, walking its own approach.

He studied the larger figure for a long moment. The movement was distinctive — not the frenetic energy of the berserker lines, not the rangy looseness of the kin-group fighters. Controlled. Measuring. The way a man moved when he was adding things up and didn't like the sum but was going to act on it anyway.

He handed the lens back to the scout without comment.

The sun had moved again. Perhaps two hours past midday now. The light was thinner and the smoke had gone from a single column to a general haze that sat over the city's western quarter like something that planned to stay.

He stood in it and breathed through his mouth and felt the siege settling around him the way a siege always settled — not like a thing that had arrived, but like a thing that had always been there, waiting. The gates closing had simply made it visible.

The goblin crews finished the engine placement. The first catapult was set. He watched them make the final angle adjustment, the arm pulled back, the crew standing clear, the lead goblin running a calibration calculation with something scratched on his forearm. They were sighting on the lower ring again. They had the range from the first strike and they were confirming it. That meant the next impact would land within fifty yards of the first.

He needed to issue the dispersion orders. Move civilians from the Hall district to the inner ring shelters. Route the assessment team through the secondary corridor. Adjust the garrison distribution to cover the new engine positions.

He needed to do seventeen things at once and he had enough men to do perhaps eleven of them.

He would do eleven. He would note the other six and revisit when the math changed.

He put his hands on the stone and looked at the field. The orc advance was ordered and patient. The siege engines were in position. The banners numbered forty-five that he could see. The horde moved behind its treeline like a tide that didn't need permission.

The first organized advance was beginning.

Not a charge. A formation move — the Ironclaw's leading elements shifting from position-hold to forward press, the blocks contracting and orienting on the gate. He watched it happen. It was precise. Someone on that side of the wall was good at this.

He did not call out orders. The orders were already given, and his men were doing what trained men did. He watched the advance and felt the wall under his hands, the cold grit of stone and the old iron of the reinforced facing, the way it pressed back against his palms with the weight of everything behind it.

The smoke from the burned cart had dissipated. The smoke from the lower ring had not.

He kept his eyes on the field.

He did not turn.
