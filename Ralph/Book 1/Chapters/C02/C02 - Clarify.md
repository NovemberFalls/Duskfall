Before I draft `C02`, I need two quick clarifications to stay aligned with your canon and pacing.

1. What is the exact POV and scene scope for `C02` (who, where, and which day/hour)?
2. Any specific beats you want included or avoided in this chapter?

POV, Scope, and Timeline

Title: The Wall Closes
Primary POV: Warden Alric Stoneveil
Secondary POV: None
Day: Day 1 — Midday to early afternoon
Timeframe: Immediately after the first artillery strike (the blast that separates November and Horus)

This is the moment the city shifts from civilian to fortress.

C01 ends in rubble and smoke.

C02 begins with Stoneveil already moving.

Scene Scope

Location:

Sundered Gate ramparts

Inner command corridor

View over outer ring

No street-level chaos (that’s later)

This chapter is about command posture, not emotional collapse.

2️⃣ Must-Hit Beats
Required
1. Immediate Tactical Response

Gate lockdown

Signal relays

Horn calls

Troop reallocation

Stoneveil giving clipped orders

No speeches.

Just command.

2. First Realization of Scale

Not a raid

Not a probing attack

This is full siege

Stoneveil recognizes it before anyone says it aloud.

3. Civilian Cost (Distant, Not Emotional)

He receives reports:

“Impact in lower district.”

Casualty estimates unknown.

He does not react emotionally.

But we see:

A pause.

A micro-beat.

Then forward motion.

No guilt monologue.

4. Glimpse of the Horde

First clear sight of:

Orc banners

Siege engines

Goblin crews adjusting range

This is the reader’s first wide look.

But from Stoneveil’s limited perspective.

No omniscient overview.

5. The Weight of the Anvil (Fragment Only)

One sensory trigger:

Smoke smell

Fireline pattern

Burning timber

Flash fragment of:

The Anvil District fire

No explanation.
No exposition.
Just intrusion.

Then suppression.

6. The Order

Stoneveil gives an order that:

Prioritizes military positioning over civilian rescue

It is correct.

It costs something.

We do not dramatize it.
We show the cost through behavior.

What to Avoid in C02

No November POV bleed.

No mythologizing Stoneveil.

No “Unyielding Shield” epic framing.

No dramatic battlefield poetry.

No moral speech.

No emotional confession.

No Thokk POV yet.

Thokk appears in C03.

Emotional Register

C01 = intimate rupture
C02 = tightening steel

Reader should feel:

The fist closing.

Chapter Ending Target

End with:

Stoneveil watching the first organized advance begin.

The siege has officially started.

No victory.
No collapse yet.

Just inevitability.

Structural Reason

C01 makes us care.

C02 makes us understand.

C03 introduces Thokk and the mirror.

That is the clean architecture.
