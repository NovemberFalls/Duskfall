Stoneveil was already moving when the second horn sounded.

The first blast had ripped the air open. The second turned the alarm into rhythm. He had boots on stone, a gauntleted fist on the railing, the horizon in his sightline. Smoke lay low over the outer ring, rolling from the lower districts toward the gate like a tide.

“Seal the gate,” he said.

The gate marshal nodded once and relayed. Steel wheels groaned. Chains took strain. The Sundered Gate began to close.

“Signal tower, north. Light the red. Two long, one short.” Stoneveil’s voice did not rise. It did not need to.

A runner broke from the corridor, lean and fast. Stoneveil watched him go and counted the distance by steps he’d measured years ago. Seventy-two to the tower stairs. Another thirty to the platform. Forty seconds if the boy didn’t trip on the ash.

He swung his gaze to the outer ring. The Sundered Gate was the throat of the city. If it failed, everything behind it died.

“Captain Veyne,” he said.

She was already beside him. Ironbound Guard, helm under one arm, hair tight, eyes forward.

“Line three is thin,” she said. “They bled in the first hit.”

“Pull two squads from the inner reserve. Replace them.”

She hesitated. “Inner?”

“They won’t reach the wall in time if this turns.” He pointed. “Line three will.” He didn’t explain further. She knew the map. She knew the distance. She knew the weight.

Veyne turned and called it down the corridor. Her voice cut through the noise like a blade.

Stoneveil lifted his spyglass. The glass rim was cool through his glove. The outer ring lay below, a set of low ridges and broken alleys. Smoke rose in pillars from the lower districts. Not the Anvil. Not yet. South of it. Dockside, maybe. Civilians lived there. Grain houses. Carts. Narrow roofs.

A flare went up near the river. Someone marking a collapse. Or a breach. He didn’t have time to name it.

“Report!” a runner shouted as he crossed the rampart.

Stoneveil stopped him with a hand on the chestplate. The boy’s eyes were too wide.

“Lower district. Impact. East of the river.” He swallowed. “Casualties unknown.”

“Keep moving,” Stoneveil said.

The boy went. Stoneveil watched him go too, the way you watch a fuse burn. Then he looked back out.

The fog of smoke was already thinning. Wind from the west. Good for sight. Bad for the lower rings.

He caught motion beyond the outer ring, just at the edge of the broken field. Shapes. Lines. Not the loose sprawl of raiders. It was too even. Too measured.

“Formed,” he said, and then quietly, “Not a raid.”

The words didn’t carry far. They were for him.

He took the spyglass up again. The horizon filled with bodies. Orcs in ranks. Banners held low against the wind. A line of black iron teeth on poles. The Ironclaw. The skull of something large hung beneath one standard, swaying with each step. Goblin crews moved between frames of wood and brass, hunched and quick, adjusting the angles of their war machines. A cart of twisted beams rolled forward. A sling arm jutted from it like a broken limb.

A horn sounded beyond the walls, low and long. Not a call. A statement.

Stoneveil lowered the glass.

“Get me the engineers,” he said to no one in particular.

He stepped away from the parapet. The inner corridor was packed with movement: messengers, armored officers, smiths with toolboxes, a priest in grey carrying a bowl of salt and oil. The corridor always felt narrow when the city was breathing fast.

“Warden!” an officer called from the stairwell. “Signal from the northern watch: lights on the ridge. Two reds.”

“They see the camp,” Stoneveil said. “Tell them to keep counting.” He moved past.

The command room was a long chamber of stone and ash. A map of the outer ring was pinned to the table, weighted by iron spikes. Small wooden blocks marked garrisons and reserves. A black pebble in the lower district marked the first impact.

“Sir,” the mapkeeper said, already watching him, “outer ring reporting. They’re asking if they should send rescue to the lower district.”

Stoneveil set his gauntlet on the table. It made the blocks jump.

“No.”

The room went quiet. The mapkeeper’s mouth opened, shut. Someone behind Stoneveil shifted their weight, then stillness.

“The district is compromised,” Stoneveil said. “Send fire crews to contain spread. No soldiers out. They’ll want the gate to open. We do not open.”

He did not add what he didn’t have to. The gate opening would be a blood invitation.

Veyne entered and took her place on the far side of the table. “Inner reserve is moving.”

“Two squads only,” he said.

“Already done.”

He nodded, a small dip of the head. Her efficiency was a relief he could not afford to feel.

“Where’s Blackthorn?” he asked.

“Emberheart. He’s sending a courier.”

Stoneveil said nothing.

A whistle cut through the corridor outside. High and sharp. A signal. Another came in answer, lower, from the south. He tracked them automatically, a map in his mind as clear as the one on the table. East tower. West tower. Gate. Inner ring.

“Sir,” the mapkeeper said, “reports from the lower district—”

“Hold,” Stoneveil said. “I will take them when I can use them.”

He looked down at the map. The outer ring was a shallow arc. The Sundered Gate sat at its center. Three choke points. Two towers. One breach point from last winter’s flood, already reinforced, still weak.

“Put a block on the flood breach,” he said.

“Already there,” the mapkeeper said.

“Add one more.”

That drew a look from Veyne. It was subtle, but he saw it.

“We need to keep our line thick,” he said. “They won’t probe. They’ll push.”

“You’re sure?” she asked.

He met her eyes, and in them he saw the question she didn’t ask. Are you sure it’s the Ironclaw? Are you sure it’s not a raid? Are you sure we won’t need that unit for the lower district?

He nodded.

She turned without another word.

Stoneveil moved to the doorway and looked out over the rampart. Men were moving into place. Spear crews and bow lines. The gate chains were settling into their locks. The iron mouth of the Sundered Gate was nearly closed now, leaving a slit of light.

He lifted his arm. “Close it.”

The marshal gave a sign. The chains snapped tight. The gate thudded shut. The sound travelled through the stone and into his bones. Emberfall had sealed itself.

A sharp crack cut the air. Another. Stoneveil flinched before he could stop it. The sound of burning timber. Not the crack of siege impact. Smaller. Closer. A smell followed it, thin and oily.

Smoke.

For half a heartbeat, not now but then: a wall of fire, rolling down a street he knew by the curve of the gutter and the shape of the forge roof. He saw a line of flame along an awning and the way it moved—too fast, too clean. He saw the heat shimmer above cobbles.

He turned away from the wall. The fragment died.

“Warden,” a voice said.

He found a priest at the edge of the corridor, older, skin drawn tight over bone. A man of Tyr, judging by the blue cord at his neck.

“I can bless the line,” the priest said. “If you allow it.”

Stoneveil’s mouth went dry. He swallowed.

“Do it,” he said. “Stay off the wall.”

The priest bowed and moved away, fingers already at the bowl.

Stoneveil returned to the map. He could not stand on the wall and command. He needed the corridor and the table. The gate needed his eyes, but the city needed his mind.

“Runner,” he called, and the nearest boy snapped to attention. “Find the fire crews. I want lines cut between the lower district and the river. If they can’t hold, they pull back. No one opens the east gate without my order.”

“Yes, sir.”

The boy ran.

Stoneveil looked down and moved a marker. A red block for the line three shift. A black pebble now paired with another on the lower district, to mark that it was not one fire, but several. He could feel the pressure of the room, the way every set of eyes hovered on him for a decision.

He did not give them time to breathe.

“Signal to the outer ring,” he said. “No sorties. Keep the wall. Count their siege engines and relay every thirty minutes.”

The scribe nodded and scratched it down.

“Get me a report on munitions,” he said. “Fire pots, bolts, oil. I want the numbers before they come into range.”

“Sir,” Veyne said, “if we pull another block to the flood breach, the inner corridor is thin.”

Stoneveil was already thinking. “It will be thinner if they crack the breach. The inner corridor does not hold a charge. The gate does.”

He didn’t mention the lower district. He didn’t mention civilians. The words would have made the decision softer. It was not a soft decision.

Another runner arrived, panting. “Signal from the south tower. Goblin crews sighted. Three engines, maybe four.”

“Describe them.”

“Frames. Sling arms. They’re… building one, sir.”

Stoneveil nodded. “Tell them to mark range.”

He went back to the rampart.

The air had a taste now, iron and ash. You could feel the city’s breath catching, like a man who has realized the blade is already in his gut.

Down below, men were hauling supplies to the parapets. Crates of bolts, barrels of oil, coils of rope. The shift leaders barked, and the men answered.

Stoneveil scanned the line. Most were in place. Some faces were too young. Some too old. But the line was there. That mattered.

He took the spyglass again. The orc line had advanced. You could see the shape of their armor now, dark plates, rough, uneven. They moved with discipline. That was the Ironclaw. No screaming, no random charge. A line of shields came forward and knelt. Behind them, goblins loaded a sling.

Stoneveil’s jaw tightened. The machines weren’t set for random bombardment. They were measuring.

He watched as a goblin crew leaned into a crank. The sling arm lowered. A rock, black and wet, slid into the cradle. He could see the goblin’s bare hands, quick, small, stained with oil.

“Mark the impact,” he said to the men on the wall. “No one flinches.”

The first stone came in low. It cleared the outer ring and slammed into the lower district with a crack that echoed off the inner wall. Dust rose.

Another followed, higher, striking nearer to the outer ring. A third hit the river and sent a plume of water over the embankment. They were bracketing.

“Shields up,” Stoneveil called.

Men raised their shields, not because the stones could reach the wall yet, but because it gave their hands something to do.

The door behind him opened. Veyne stepped out, breath steady.

“Inner reserve in position,” she said.

“Good.” He didn’t look at her. He was watching the goblins.

He saw a new banner rise. This one was not iron teeth. This one was a claw, red, set against a field of black. He didn’t need the glass to know whose it was. Warlord’s standard. He had seen it once before, at the edge of a skirmish line years ago. It had not been this close.

“Warden,” a messenger said, “Emberheart sends this.”

Stoneveil took the sealed slip, broke it. Lord Commander Blackthorn’s hand was firm and slow.

Hold the gate. Preserve the inner ring. I will not open the Emberheart to evac.

Stoneveil crumpled the paper in his fist. He did not show it to anyone. He put it in his pocket.

He watched the orcs again. They were raising ladders. Not yet. Not now. The goblins would soften first. The orcs would come when the wall was cracked and the men were tired.

A hiss sounded at his elbow. The priest from earlier had returned, now splashing oil on the stones and murmuring words that had no power but a strange steadiness. A line of soldiers bowed their heads briefly, then went back to their work.

Stoneveil did not kneel. He stood and watched.

A runner arrived from the lower district. This one was soot-black, eyes red. He stopped in front of Stoneveil and struggled to breathe.

“Speak.”

“Fire in Dockside. Grain houses. People trapped. The guard at East Gate asked if they could open for evac.”

Stoneveil looked past him to the east gate, a dark line on the far wall. It was small and low. It was a soft spot.

“No,” he said.

The runner’s shoulders fell. He nodded and ran.

Stoneveil stared at the smoke line. It was thick now, a horizontal scar. He could imagine the people in it, the way a man’s mind fills in what he has seen before.

He forced his thoughts back to the wall. There was no time to mourn a fire. There was only time to stop the next one.

A series of horns sounded from the outer ring. The pattern was clear: advance.

Stoneveil lifted the spyglass one more time. The orc line was moving, slow, heavy. The goblin crews were pulling back as the engines cycled. A rank of shield-bearers formed a wedge. Behind them, spears rose, a forest of points.

He lowered the glass.

“Lines ready!” he called.

The officers echoed him down the wall. Men gripped spears. Arrows slid to string.

Stoneveil planted his boots at the parapet and set his hand on the cold stone. The smoke was thick now, the taste of it in his mouth. The lower district burned. The gate held. The wall stood.

He watched the first organized advance begin. The siege had started.
