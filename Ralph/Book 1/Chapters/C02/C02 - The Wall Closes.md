Stoneveil was already moving when the first runner reached the rampart.

Smoke pushed across the Sundered Gate in a low, ugly roll, thick enough to turn the world gray. It tasted wrong. Not coal. Not forge. Timber and oil and something sweet that didn’t belong in a wall-fortress at noon.

“Warden.” The runner skidded, breath sawing. “Impact in lower district. Unknown scale.”

Stoneveil did not look away from the horizon. “Seal Gate. Double the inner bolts. Signal tower three. Horn for third cordon.”

“Yes, sir.”

The boy ran. Stoneveil’s fingers were on the stone. The parapet was warm from the forge vents beneath. The wind shifted and the smoke thinned for a heartbeat. Past the outer ring, the black line of the horde showed itself like a bruise across the plain.

He lifted his spyglass.

The siege engines were already in place. Low profiles. Wide wheels. Goblin crews in ranks. He counted. One. Two. Three, four, five. More behind. Orc standards broke in the wind, iron rings clattering. No raiders. No probing band. A wall of bodies, work crews, beasts. This was a hard commitment.

“Captain Kestrel,” he said.

Kestrel was at his elbow, steel-capped boots on stone. “Sir.”

“Reassign the north block. Shift two companies from the east postern to the second ring. Let the east hold with garrison.”

“They’ll be thin.”

“Thin is still standing. We need weight at the Gate.”

“Yes, sir.” Kestrel moved.

Stoneveil kept the glass up. The goblin crews were laying range lines. He watched a hand go up, two fingers, then a sweep. Timing. They were working off pre-marked positions. This was planned. This was measured.

A horn sounded behind him. One long note. Gate lockdown. The city’s breathing narrowed.

The inner command corridor was already alive, runners moving in both directions, the air packed with iron and soot. A message boy took his left sleeve. “Warden, Master Reeve requests—”

“Tell the Reeve no street clearances. All inner gates closed. He can sort his own chaos.” Stoneveil did not slow. He moved through the corridor with his escort, short steps, no wasted motion. The stone underfoot pulsed with heat from the forges below. Emberfall never cooled.

The map table waited in the command room, heavy and scarred. Chalk lines marked the rings. He planted both palms on the table. “Report.”

Kestrel returned with a fresh map in hand. “Signal towers two, three, and five are lit. East postern reduced. North block in motion. Gate crews at double.”

“Casualties?”

“Unknown. First impact in lower district. Fires in the Cinder alleys. Market row hit. Reports of collapse.”

Stoneveil’s eyes paused on the lower ring on the map. A blank space to the west of the Anvil line. He saw the lines of streets there, remembered how they’d been before. He did not let it reach his face.

“Sound the horn for outer ring reserve,” he said. “Lock the outer ring gates from this side. No traffic. No exceptions.”

Kestrel hesitated.

Stoneveil looked up.

“Sir. There are still civilians crossing in—”

“No exceptions.”

“Yes, sir.”

He turned back to the map. The first barrage had been aimed at the lower ring. That meant the engines already had range on the walls. They wanted panic, smoke, and flames to pull defenders inward. Classic. The goblins were not just technicians. They were reading the city’s response.

He stepped out onto the rampart again. The wind shifted. The smell hit him full. Burning pitch. Hot iron. A line of flame in memory. Timber stacked. Oil poured. The Anvil, lit from within like a furnace. He blinked once, hard, and the image went.

“Warden.” Another runner, older, gray at the temples. “Outer ring watch reports movement. Organized advance. They’re forming.”

Stoneveil nodded. “Banners?”

“Ironclaw. Many. Goblin crews with carts.”

He raised the spyglass again. Orcs were moving in disciplined ranks, shield lines, spears low, the front crouched. He saw a standard with a skull hung at the crossbeam. Thokk’s mark. That meant the Warlord was here. Not a raid. Not a test. The full weight.

Stoneveil’s jaw set. He lowered the glass. “Sound the war-horn. Long call. Then three short. Full siege.”

The horn call rolled across the city, low and brutal. Three short blasts followed, clipped, urgent. The sound went through stone, through bodies. Somewhere below, a child would cry. Somewhere else, a soldier would put on his helm and feel it tighten around his skull.

He moved down the rampart to the signal tower platform. The flag crew was already at the lines. He took the cord himself. Black and red. The code for full siege. The cloth snapped and climbed. The second flag, gray and white, called for reserve movement.

Stoneveil watched the banners ripple. On the plain, the first goblin engine fired again. The shot arced, long and slow, then dropped behind the outer ring. A dull thump reached them a heartbeat later. There was a brief scream, cut off.

“Range,” he said, more to himself than anyone.

Kestrel stepped back to his side. “Sir, the east postern will be thin. If they probe—”

“They won’t.” Stoneveil watched the line. “They’re coming here. They’ll put their weight on the Gate. The rest is noise.”

He walked to the wall edge and looked down into the outer ring. Troops were moving, not running. Shields up. Spears forward. He saw the signal torches flare. The system was working. That was all he needed. Efficiency. Discipline. The city had five minutes before the wall shook.

“Captain,” he said. “I want the mortar crews on the high platforms. Full arc to the kill zone. Two teams on the Gate. No firing until I say.”

Kestrel nodded. “Yes, sir.”

A runner arrived, breathless. “Warden. Wardsman from the lower ring. He says the Hall of the Fallen took a hit. He wants permission to move injured to the inner corridor.”

Stoneveil turned. “No. Inner corridor stays clear for troop movement. He can use the south passage and the stone stair. Tell him to keep his people off the command line.”

The runner opened his mouth, then shut it. “Yes, sir.”

Stoneveil turned back to the wall.

The outer ring was awake now. The men at the parapet stood shoulder to shoulder, helmets bright. The world beyond the wall looked like a single dark mass, but he could pick out the structure. Wedge formations. Siege ladders on sleds. Goblin crews pushing frames. Orcs in front, thick as iron slabs. Behind them, something larger moved in shadow. A ram, or a beast to pull it. He watched for the Warlord. He did not see him. That was fine. The iron would hit either way.

A pause. A beat. The city drew in.

“Stoneveil.”

He turned. Aldric Blackthorn stood in the command room doorway, two guards with him. The Lord Commander’s cloak was clean. His face was composed.

“Lord Commander,” Stoneveil said.

Blackthorn stepped in, voice even. “Report.”

“First barrage hit lower ring. Fires. Civilian casualties unknown. Enemy massing for organized advance. Full siege. Gate locked. Outer ring in position. Reserves moving to second ring. Mortars in place.”

Blackthorn nodded. “We need the outer ring to hold.”

“It will,” Stoneveil said.

“And if it doesn’t?”

Stoneveil looked back at the map. The next line in was the Iron Marches. He had bled for those walls. He would again if he had to. “Then we fall back in order. No rout. We make them pay for each step.”

Blackthorn’s gaze lingered on him. “Hold the Gate.”

Stoneveil’s reply was simple. “Yes.”

The Lord Commander left without another word. The guards followed. The corridor swallowed them.

Stoneveil moved back to the parapet. The first ranks of the horde were in motion now, a dark tide rolling forward, shield edges glinting. The gap between them and the wall narrowed. He counted the paces in his head. He knew the range, the kill zones, the angles. He did not think about the city below. He did not think about the lower ring burning. He did not think about the Anvil.

He lifted his arm.

“Mortar crews,” he called. The voice carried without being loud. He had a way of cutting through noise. “On my mark.”

The crews leaned in. Faces grimy. Hands on triggers. The weapons looked like short iron throats, squat and ugly. They were not elegant. They were effective.

The orcs closed. The goblin crews pushed their ladders forward. The first shields splashed into the shallow trench at the wall’s base. A horn from the plain blared, deeper than the city’s. The two sounds met and held.

Stoneveil waited. He counted the steps. Fifty. Forty. Thirty.

“Mark,” he said.

The mortars spoke. The world snapped with sound and smoke. He watched the arcs, quick and low. Impacts blossomed among the front ranks. Bodies lifted, then fell. The line wavered.

“Again,” he said.

The crews loaded. The blasts rolled out. The air filled with grit. He saw the first ladder drop, slammed by a blast. Another made it to the wall. Orcs surged to it.

“Archers,” he said. “Loose.”

Strings twanged. Arrows hissed. The orcs on the ladders shuddered and fell, taking men with them. The line pressed anyway. They had numbers. They had discipline. They climbed.

Stoneveil stepped to the edge. He did not shout. “Hold.”

The first orc head cleared the parapet. A defender’s axe took it. Blood painted the stones. Another came, hand on iron. A spear took it through the throat. The wall began to shake under boots and screams.

He kept his eyes on the horizon between strikes. The engines were firing in cadence now. Shots arced overhead. He tracked one with the corner of his eye. It fell inside the outer ring. The impact shook the wall. Smoke climbed.

“Warden,” Kestrel said, breath close to his ear. “Reports from lower ring. The infirmary is full. They’re moving wounded into the market hall. They want to breach the inner corridor to cross.”

“No,” Stoneveil said.

“They say they can’t—”

“No. We need the corridor. Troops are moving.”

Kestrel’s jaw tightened. “Yes, sir.”

Stoneveil watched the wall. An orc slammed a hooked blade into the parapet. He pulled. A defender stabbed down, the blade catching in muscle. The orc did not let go. He climbed with the blade in his shoulder. He was killed at the top and fell, dragging the dead man with him.

Stoneveil did not flinch. He kept his hands on the stone. His mind ran the lines. Enemy ladders, three breaches, two repelled. Mortar cadence good. Archers holding. The left flank was bowing. He glanced. A shield line was wobbling near the third buttress. He pointed.

“Second squad, reinforce the left buttress. Now.”

The squad moved. No running. No shouting. They went into the pressure like a door closing.

The world narrowed to the wall. The noise was everywhere. Metal, breath, the heavy chuff of bodies climbing. He did not look down. The base of the wall was a blur of limbs and ladders. The job was here, in the line, in the hands.

Another engine shot hit the outer ring. The blast punched a hole in a roof, sending timber shards across the yard. He saw men duck and keep moving. No one broke.

A runner pushed to the parapet, face streaked with soot. “Warden! Signal from tower five—east postern reports contact. Small probing force.”

Stoneveil looked once toward the east. He could not see it. He did not need to. “Hold with garrison. No redeploy. We can’t strip the Gate.”

“Yes, sir.”

The runner went.

The wall held. It did not feel like victory. It felt like weight.

The pressure came in waves. The orcs would surge, ladders scraping, then retreat under the mortar burst and arrow rain, then surge again. Stoneveil counted the cycles. He adjusted the cadence. He ordered the mortar crews to stagger fire, to keep the line churning. He told the archers to focus on ladder crews, not the fighters. He moved two spearmen from the right to the left, then sent them back when the right bowed. Every move was a cost. He did not think about the cost. He read the line, and he spent what he had.

Between surges, he saw the city in pieces behind the outer ring. Smoke from the lower district curled up in strips. He knew the streets there. He had walked them once. He did not look long.

The smell hit him again. Burning timber. It brought a single image, uninvited: a line of fire racing along the Anvil roofs, the heat rolling up like a breath. He did not see faces. He saw the line, the angle, the pattern. He swallowed. The image broke. He moved on.

“Warden.” A sergeant came with a helmet tucked under his arm, blood on the rim. “Outer ring north ladder breach. Two in. Contained.”

“Seal it.” Stoneveil’s voice did not change. “Two shields. One spear. No chase.”

“Yes, sir.”

He watched the main line again. The orcs had brought up a shield wall at the base. They were protecting the ladder crews now. He could see the slight shift in tactics. He felt a strange, brief admiration for the discipline of it. Then he shut it down. There was no room for that.

He raised his arm. “Second mortar team. Shift ten degrees left. Target shield wall. Short fuse.”

The crew moved. The shot arced lower. It hit the front, splintering shields and bodies. The ladder crew stumbled. The wall breathed.

Stoneveil kept his face still. He tracked the line. He tracked the engines. He tracked the distances to the second ring.

A horn sounded from the inner corridor. Three short blasts. Reserve units had reached the second ring. That was good. He allowed himself a single breath.

A new runner reached him, young, shaking, eyes wide. “Warden, they’re asking for— for permission to evacuate the Cinder alleys. The fire’s—”

“No,” Stoneveil said. He did not raise his voice. “All inner gates remain closed. Evacuation slows the line.”

The runner stared.

Stoneveil looked at him. “Tell them to get to the stone stair. Use the south passage. If they can’t, they stay. Understood?”

The boy swallowed. “Yes, sir.” He ran.

Kestrel watched him go. “Sir.”

Stoneveil did not answer.

Another wave hit. The orcs got three ladders up at once. Two defenders went down in the press. Stoneveil did not move to help. He pointed. “Left ladder. Push.”

The line surged. Shields met. A defender took a blade in the neck. He fell, blood spraying the stone. Another man stepped into the gap, boots skidding on the slick. They held.

Stoneveil’s mind ran the math. Men lost. Men gained. Time.

The outer ring held. It would not hold forever.

A larger shadow moved behind the front line. A ram, drawn by thick-necked beasts. The orcs were bringing it up through the smoke. It was early for the ram. They were trying to break the Gate fast. The Gate would not break quickly. But they would hit it anyway. The sound would shake the city. The men would feel it in their teeth.

Stoneveil stepped to the edge and raised his voice, low but carrying. “Hold the Gate. You will not be relieved. You will not be rescued. You will hold.”

No speeches. No flourish. Just the truth. The men heard it. They nodded, a line of grim faces behind helms.

The ram hit the Gate. The sound rolled through the stone. Dust shook from the arch. A second hit. The iron bands held.

He watched the Gate and the line at once, triangulating. The ram crew would be vulnerable to a sortie. But he could not spare the men. He could not open the Gate. The Gate was the wall. The Gate did not open.

A report came from the inner corridor. “Warden, signal from tower two. Goblin crews adjusting range. Shots coming in deeper. Lower ring fires spreading.”

Stoneveil nodded. “Tell them to counter with smoke screens. Oil damp. Keep the outer ring visible.”

The runner went.

He returned to the wall. The sun was muted behind smoke, a coin pressed against gray. He could not tell the hour by light. He could by his body. The first shock had passed. This was the grind. The line would hold or it would break.

Stoneveil glanced down at his gauntlet. There was a smear of blood on the knuckle plate, not his. He wiped it on the stone and watched it streak dark.

A breath. A pause.

He lifted his spyglass again and looked beyond the front ranks. The horde stretched farther than the eye could hold. Not a raid. Not a probe. A siege force. It would not leave because it was bored. It would leave when it had taken the Gate or starved.

Stoneveil lowered the glass. He tasted smoke. He felt the weight of the Gate in his bones.

He turned to Kestrel. “Get me a runner to the inner command. Tell them to ready the second ring. Full stock at the Iron Marches. If we fall back, it will be by my order. No one moves until then.”

“Yes, sir.”

The next wave surged. Stoneveil raised his arm. “Archers. Loose.”

The arrows sang. The line shuddered. The wall held.

He stared at the plain, watching the first organized advance begin in full, the horde tightening its formation, the ram rolling forward under shields, the goblin crews adjusting their range with brisk, practiced motion. The siege had started. It was now a machine, and he was the part that had to keep turning.

Stoneveil set his jaw and stayed at the parapet. The fist closed.
