The first impact found Stoneveil already on the steps.

He'd been moving before the horn sounded — not because he'd known, but because the forge smoke had changed three minutes before it. Thirty years reading fire and a man learned to read what fire did to air, to pressure, to the quality of quiet that preceded violence. The smoke over the lower ring had thickened wrong — not the steady column of working forges but something wider, flatter, clinging to the rooflines as though afraid of open sky, heavy at the base in a way that natural burn never was. He was already climbing when the horn behind him split the morning open.

He took the steps two at a time. Not running. Close.

The Sundered Gate's upper walkway sat sixty feet above the street level of the outer ring. Clear days gave you the tree line at the Veil's Throat and the dark smear of the northern wastes beyond. This was not a clear day. The smoke was wrong in all directions — wrong color, wrong weight, and wrong in the way it moved against the wind instead of with it. Stoneveil reached the rampart and put both hands on the stone crenellation. The facing was cold through his gloves, old iron flush against the heel of each palm, and he pushed against it once as if testing whether it would hold him, then looked south.

The column rising from the lower ring had the pale-base, black-crown profile he knew from siege work — not forge smoke, not cook-smoke. This was sharper. Mineral and organic at once, the smell of old stone heated past its tolerance, of mortar dust and sealed rooms suddenly open to air and fire. It reached him up here as a thread first, then a current. He catalogued it and filed it and let it be information.

Three hundred twenty meters — he'd measured the dispersion angle and the drag east on the wind. The Hall of the Fallen sat approximately—

He stopped the thought. Not useful yet.

"Bracer," he said, and the sergeant was already holding the signaling cylinder. Stoneveil pulled it open. "Red-and-two to the Eighth Corridor. Gate lockdown. Veyne on the east wall in ten minutes. Not eleven."

"Sir."

"Horn relay — three long. Full siege protocol. Not two. Three." He was already moving, not waiting for acknowledgment. In siege protocol you gave the order and trusted your men. If you didn't trust your men, you fixed that before the siege arrived.

Sergeant Bracer's voice carried the relay command behind him, clean enough to cut through the ambient wall noise. The horn answered from the gate tower — one preliminary note, then the sequence: low, long, long, long. Three beats. The sound ran down the inner ring like something bleeding out through old stone.

Stoneveil kept moving. The rampart ran the full span of the Sundered Gate's upper face, two hundred yards of black stone with crenellations worn smooth by decades of armored hands. Two archers were already at their posts, watching the smoke column. He passed them. They were doing their jobs.

"Healer Renn." He stopped at the first alcove. A young woman in a half-duty sash turned toward him. "Move the trauma station from the main corridor to the secondary vault. If there's a second strike in the gate complex, I don't want the injured sharing a blast radius with the entrance."

She drew a breath.

"Now," he said, before she could find the question.

She went. He kept going.

The east tower was what he needed. From there he'd have the full sight line across the Iron Marches and the kill zone beyond. At the tower base he found two men in militia colors arguing — he couldn't hear the words above the general wall noise and didn't need to. He stopped walking. He put one hand flat against the stone beside them, touching neither man, and the argument stopped on its own.

"On the wall," he said. "Both of you."

They went.

---

The tower stairs were narrow, the stone cold and damp. His breath fogged on the way up. The iron railing at the landing turn was wet from the night's frost, still hadn't warmed — he gripped it once and felt the cold cut through the seam of his glove, a sharp line across his palm that he noted and filed. He reached the top platform and the wind came in full, carrying the smell of the lower ring more strongly up here, and something else beneath it: the particular metallic note of siege machinery, hot iron and worked stone, the smell of an army that had been moving hard and had arrived.

The Iron Marches spread below — the wide, open approach between the gate's outer walls and the city proper, empty now, civilians having cleared in the first horn response. Good. At the base of the gate structure, three soldiers worked the locking chain, the heavy links spooling through the capstan in the controlled fall of something massive and certain.

Beyond the outer walls, the Veil's Throat.

Beyond that.

Stoneveil studied it for a long moment without speaking. The land beyond was the wide, flat bowl that dipped toward the tree line — market fields in peacetime, seasonal camps of traders and hay farmers and the wandering tinkers who ran the eastern routes. Now it held something else.

He counted automatically, because numbers didn't lie and didn't break under weight. Banners. The Ironclaw's crude black-and-red standards planted at intervals through the tree line. He stopped at forty-one. Not because there weren't more. Because he had enough information.

The horde arranged in loose blocks that would coalesce under command. He could see the mass shifting in the tree line, the closer advance elements already in the kill zone. The goblins — smaller figures, fast in the way of creatures that lived on speed instead of strength — were working at something in the middle distance. He reached back without looking. "Lens."

The scout pressed a brass spyglass into his palm, cold and heavy. He raised it, found focus, brought the middle distance in.

Goblin crews. Three visible, probably five if they'd staged well. Catapult frames — the arm-and-throw style the goblins favored, quick to assemble, inaccurate without calibration, devastating once they found range. The nearest crew was adjusting the throw arm, three figures hanging off the tension rope to set the angle. Between salvos. He had timed the first strike from when the smoke changed. Counting forward: six minutes to refire, maybe seven. The calibration pause told him precisely what he needed to know.

He lowered the lens and handed it back.

"Garrison strength," he said to the scout.

"Six hundred twelve effectives as of morning muster, sir. That's before any—"

"Civilian volunteers?"

"Intake was still processing when the horn sounded. Maybe forty, maybe sixty."

"Sergeant-Major Darro in four minutes."

The scout left. Stoneveil stayed, working the numbers.

Eight hundred fifty, give or take. Against whatever waited across that treeline — forty-one banners on the visible face, the horde's mass extending west past the Rethwick waystation line, the goblin siege crews that didn't haul catapult frames through forest for a probe. The math wasn't good. He'd worked worse math.

The gate finished locking. He heard it before he felt it — the final clunk of the last pin seating in its housing, and then a faint shiver rising through the soles of his boots, the whole gate structure settling into itself with a sound like a held breath finally released. Something in the air changed after that. A pressure shift. The city's breathing reorganizing around the fact of the gate being shut. Whatever was outside was outside now. Whatever was inside was inside.

A sound rose from the inner approach road a moment later.

---

He went to the inner-face crenellation and looked down.

A supply cart had stalled in the gate corridor — the last forty feet of the arch, still inside. The cart was tangled, a wheel caught deep in a rut, the driver in the dirt working the axle with his shoulder. But the driver wasn't the problem. The problem was the people behind it: twenty, maybe thirty civilians who had made it to the gate in the horn response and arrived forty seconds too late, now pressed against the outer portcullis with their hands through the iron bars, their voices running together into a sound that wasn't quite language and wasn't quite prayer.

He counted them quickly and read the geometry from above. Cart in the arch. Portcullis down on both ends. The cart's position was stressing the inner lock mechanism — not enough to prevent seating, not yet, but enough that the load was wrong. If a strike hit the gate structure while the arch was occupied—

A gate guard below looked up. "Warden. The gate—"

"I see it." He was already reading the solution and what it cost.

The crowd at the outer portcullis was not a mob. He noticed that first. They were pushing, calling out, hands through the bars, but they hadn't broken into the formless panic of people who'd stopped believing someone was coming. Something in their arrangement still faced toward the wall as though waiting for an answer. He scanned the faces automatically, the way he read a formation, looking for the information in the arrangement.

A woman near the front. Red braid — the color that had run from full copper to something sun-worn and mixed, the way forge-row workers' hair went when they spent their days near fire. Both hands on the portcullis bars, not shaking, just holding. She wasn't screaming. She wasn't calling out. She was watching him on the rampart with an expression that understood what it was seeing and had chosen to keep looking anyway.

He knew her. Not the name — or not yet. He'd walked past the forge-row bucket line once during dry season, checking southern ring fire response capacity. She'd been running a two-handled pail faster than anyone else on the line, covering twice the distance of the man beside her, and when Stoneveil had nodded at the workers she'd nodded back without breaking stride. The braid had been brighter then. He remembered the pail. He remembered the economy of it — no wasted motion, the way the bucket never splashed. He had noted her, filed her under *functional*, and walked on.

She had a face now. He wanted her not to.

He looked at the cart. At the gate lock mechanism. At the timeline in his head — six minutes, now perhaps four — before the goblin crews finished calibration. He looked at the open approach behind the crowd, at the treeline where the horde waited. He looked at Maren at the portcullis and she was still looking at him and her hands on the bars were the hands of a woman who had already done the math and arrived at the same answer and was staying anyway, as though the looking were a form of witness.

The gate corporal was below him. Stoneveil found him without raising his voice.

"Clear the arch. Burn the cart."

The corporal was a twenty-year veteran with a face that had absorbed a great deal without collapsing. He looked up at the rampart. He looked at the cart. He looked at the portcullis and the people beyond it. He did it in two seconds, then looked back.

"Sir. The cart—"

"Burn it." He held the corporal's eyes without expression, without leaning forward, without any weight in his posture that could be called pressure except his attention remaining steady on the man. The silence ran. The corporal turned and gave the order.

Stoneveil turned back to the field. He did not watch the gate.

He heard the oil splash — the wet slap of it against dry wood. Heard the pause before the torch caught, that brief held moment before combustion committed, and then the crackle becoming a roar in the span of a single breath. The driver cursing from somewhere below. The cart going up fast. The shouts at the outer portcullis changing register.

He kept his eyes on the field.

The smoke from the cart reached him before the noise finished — close-range burning, oil and dry timber, and underneath it the sweetness that shouldn't have been there. The wrong sweetness. Old wood going up in a space where rooms were packed close and the gaps between were full of dry goods and winter stores and everything that burned slowly and long. The sky above the cart was the gate arch. The sky above the gate arch became the sky above the Anvil District at the hour before dawn, six months ago, the light orange in the wrong way, the distance wrong, the sounds wrong, buildings below him instead of a cart corridor—

He closed his eyes. Opened them.

The field. Forty-one banners, minimum, western deployment extending past the visible line. Goblin crews at the catapult frames. The advance elements in the kill zone, patient, settling into position. He found the place in his count where he'd stopped and started again. Four more banners on the western edge, partially obscured. Forty-five total. He noted it.

The Anvil District smell had gotten into his uniform for three days. Into the stone of the wall. Into the inside of his mouth when he ate. He had given the order and then he had stood on this wall and watched it execute and the smell had stayed. He breathed through his mouth now and the taste of the burning sat on the back of his tongue — char and iron and underneath it the thing that was not wood — and he noted it and let it be information and nothing else. He put the rest back. Not down. Back. Filed behind what he needed right now.

Behind him, the corporal reported the gate lock had seated fully. The arch was clear.

---

He descended to the command corridor at the same pace he'd climbed. Controlled, unhurried. The men would see him. The way he moved was information.

The corridor had organized itself into something that resembled order. He walked through it reading positions — who was on which side of the passage, who covered the blind corner at the third alcove, who was facing the wrong direction. He found Torven, one of Veyne's section leaders, and touched the man's elbow without speaking, two steps left. Better sight lines down the corridor's length. Torven adjusted without looking at him, eyes staying forward. Three years together. He knew.

Darro was waiting at the secondary vault door, thick arms crossed, soot already on his forearms from somewhere. The engineer's face was wide and patient, built for bad news. The calloused hands were calloused past the point where gloves were useful.

"The tunnels," Stoneveil said.

"Reinforcement teams are in position. Third access point under the eastern approach is the weak one. I need two more hours on it."

"You have ninety minutes."

Darro uncrossed his arms. "Warden, the load projection on that brace—"

"What you need and what you have aren't the same thing." He said it without heat. "Allocate where the math says. You know how to do it."

The engineer looked at him for a moment — not defiant, just a man finishing the arithmetic he'd already started. Then: "I'll need to pull a team from the secondary."

"Pull them."

A runner arrived with the first written field report. Stoneveil opened it at a walking pace and read it moving. Strike confirmed in the lower district. Structural damage to the Hall of the Fallen approach. Fire teams unable to respond due to gate lockdown. Civilian casualties unknown. He handed it back.

"File it. Tell the assessment team four-hour mark, not before. Don't put my name on any civilian casualty communication until we have numbers."

The runner lingered a half-beat, the way runners did when they expected something more — some acknowledgment of what the report contained, some visible weight to show the information had landed. He said nothing further. The runner went.

---

He came back to the rampart by the eastern access, taking the lower observation tier this time, which gave a wider horizontal view without the angle compression of the tower. From here he could read the full sweep of the approach without distortion.

The horde had moved forward.

Not a charge. A purposeful shift — the advance elements coming out of the tree line cover in the Ironclaw's characteristic clustering: not military columns but kin-group blocks, each tight around a fighter bearing a banner or a bone-hung standard. The bone standards were clear from here. War-shaman presence. Ritual preparation.

Which meant weeks of planning. Someone had walked the approach routes, clocked the sight lines from the goblin engine positions, chosen the Hall of the Fallen as the first ranging strike not by accident but by design. Someone had been inside this city, or had spoken at length to people who had. He filed it. He would need it later.

A light percussion reached him from somewhere on the inner wall — hammers on iron, a repair crew working under pressure. Below that, barely audible, the rhythmic creak of the eastern ballista being rotated to its new bearing. And beneath all of it, rising and falling with the wind, the low collective noise of the horde establishing itself in the kill zone: not the shouts of a charge but something more patient and vast, the sound of mass organizing itself with purpose.

Captain Veyne arrived on the final three steps, her boots announcing her precisely. She came to stand at his left shoulder and looked at the field without waiting to be asked.

Her iron-plated armor was at its working sheen — not parade finish, but the even mirror surface she maintained as a matter of discipline. Hallowfang rode across her back in its accustomed position, the double-edged longsword's grip angled right for the cross-draw, the leather wrap worn to the shape of her hand. The silver Tyr emblem on her belt caught the flat afternoon light for a moment and didn't. Her short-cropped hair, silver-streaked at the temple and crown, was damp at the edge where the helmet had sat. Sharp features working through whatever she'd seen on her way to the wall.

She read the field the way he read it — not watching, but working.

"Southeast block," she said. "That's a discipline march."

"Yes."

"They're not probing."

"No."

A pause. He heard her draw a breath that wasn't quite steady and release it clean.

"How many," she said. Not a question.

"Unknown. More than the banners suggest. Western deployment extends past the Rethwick waystation." He traced the line with one hand, not pointing. "We won't see the full count until they commit."

She said nothing. She was reading what he was reading. She was good at that.

"East wall," he said. "Alternating split shifts. Four hours maximum on post. If they're staged for a long approach and we hold the garrison at full attention through it, we burn ourselves before they reach the gate."

"I'll need to rearrange the Third and Sixth."

"Do it."

She didn't move immediately. He was aware of her presence the way you were aware of a wall you'd leaned against long enough — solid, known, reliable in the specific way of things that had held under testing.

"The lower ring," she said carefully.

He kept his eyes on the field. "What about it."

"The Hall. The civilian workers. The healers who were on shift when the horn sounded—"

"I know."

She stopped. He could feel her reading his posture — the stillness of his hands on the stone, the angle of his jaw. She had the sense not to ask what he was going to do about it. She already knew. Saying it aloud helped neither of them.

"Four hours," he said. "Assessment team at four hours."

One nod, sharp. No ceremony. Boots on stone, going.

---

The sun had shifted past midday — the light from the southwest now, pale and flat, thinned by the haze that had settled over the western quarter like something that intended to stay. He felt the time in his knees the way he always felt extended standing, a slow heat behind the joints, a clock that didn't lie.

Below, the gate corridor had cleared. The cart's remains were a dark smear and a thread of smoke, almost gone. The inner approach was clean. The lock was seated.

A soldier arrived with a water skin and held it out without a word. Stoneveil took it, drank twice, handed it back. The soldier stepped away. He knew better than to hover.

The goblins were at their engines again. One catapult had cleared the treeline — hauled by six crews working in coordinated chaos, every motion frantic until suddenly it wasn't, the engine finding its position with a final jolt. He felt it arrive: a faint tremor rising through the stone into his palms, a vibration that traveled the full length of the rampart and died somewhere in the gate structure behind him. The lead goblin was already scratching calibration figures on his forearm, comparing them to something scratched in the dirt. Precise work. Careful work. The kind of precision that had survived whatever journey brought those frames through forest and over the eastern approaches.

Someone had protected those engines on the march. Had built something worth protecting.

The engines would be ranged within the hour. He needed Darro's underground timeline revised, the east wall archers briefed on the new positions, a field report from the secondary vault, a civilian count from inner ring administration. He was composing the order sequence when the wind shifted.

It came from the south, brief and cold, carrying the smoke from the lower ring directly into his face. He caught it full — burning timber, old wood going up fast, the sweet-rotten quality of it that shouldn't have been sweet, and beneath it the secondary smell. The one that had nothing to do with the cart. The one that was not wood. Older than wood. The Anvil District smell, the one that had gotten into his uniform for three days and into the stone of this wall and into the inside of his mouth when he ate. The one that told you the fire had found something that wasn't supposed to burn and had found it anyway and was not done.

Six months ago he had stood on this wall and given the order and watched it execute. Drelgar Blackhand had died in the first ten minutes. The rest had taken longer. He had not looked away then either.

He breathed through his mouth. The taste of the burning settled on the back of his tongue — iron, ash, the specific sweetness of the thing beneath — and he let it settle. He put the rest back. Not down. Back. Filed behind what he needed right now.

The field called him back and he answered.

---

Darro's second arrived at the stair head, a young woman named Carris carrying the engineer's chalk board, slightly out of breath from the climb. The lines showed the tunnel access points from above, reinforcement status, load projections, Darro's compressed shorthand running the margins.

"Tunnel three," she said. "Darro says forty minutes, not ninety. They worked faster."

"Good." He scanned the board. "The stress rating on the secondary brace. What's the number."

"Darro said not to tell you that."

He looked at her. She was perhaps twenty-two and she looked back without flinching, which meant Darro had prepared her for exactly this.

"Tell him I need the number," he said. "Not his assessment of what the number means. The number itself."

She went.

The sun moved again. Perhaps two hours past midday — the light thinner, the haze over the western quarter persistent. The orc advance was fully established in the kill zone, settled into position, not pressing toward the wall but present. Making themselves the fact of the situation.

Two figures separated from the edge of the orc formation and began walking the perimeter at the limit of bow range. Slow, deliberate. Stopping to look at the wall from different angles. He raised the lens and found them.

One orc, broad as anything built from iron and patience — not the bulk of the berserker lines, not the loose slung movement of the kin-group fighters. Something more considered. The movement was controlled in the way of a man who had stopped needing to prove things through how he moved. Economy of step. Eyes tracking the wall in a systematic pattern, north to south, looking for the seams. At the corner of the outer wall he stopped and stood still for longer than a man studying defenses needed to, as though accounting for something the eyes couldn't report directly. The other figure was smaller and faster, staying two steps behind — not a guard position but something adjacent to it, a reader, maybe, or a handler.

Not scouts. Something above scouts. Someone who had come to see the thing himself rather than trust what others had carried back.

He studied the larger figure for a long moment. The patience of it. The way it stood at the corner of the wall and stood still and read the stonework like a thing that had already decided and was merely confirming the decision was sound.

He handed the lens back without comment.

The written report arrived from Carris: Darro's number in chalk on a slate. Seventy-three percent. Below optimal by enough to matter. He would give Darro the forty minutes. He would tell him to live with the rating and do the best work possible inside it.

Below, the daily sounds of siege preparation organized themselves around the new shape of the day — armor being checked, equipment repositioned, soldiers finding their stations. Not chaotic. The sounds of trained men doing trained things. He listened to them and found them acceptable.

The first organized advance was beginning.

Not a charge. A formation move — the Ironclaw's leading elements shifting from position-hold to forward press, the kin-group blocks contracting and orienting on the gate. Measured, patient, the way an engine was patient between salvos. He watched the blocks tighten. Watched the banner poles come to a consistent angle. Watched the bone standards moving with the formations, the war-shamans keeping pace.

Someone on that side of the field was good at this. Someone had built a horde that moved like a fist, not a flood. That was worth knowing. That was worth accounting for.

He did not call out orders. The orders were already given and his men were doing what trained men did. He watched the advance and felt the wall under his hands — the cold grit of old stone, the iron reinforcing flush against his palms, the weight of two hundred years pressed back against him with the specific solidity of things that had been built to hold. The crenellation under his thumbs was worn smooth by decades of hands in this same position, men before him looking at this same approach, and he was part of that sequence now, one more body in the line, which was not comfort but was something adjacent to it.

The smoke from the burned cart had dissipated. The smoke from the lower ring had not. It sat over the western quarter in the low, flat way of something that had settled in for the duration — not rising, just present, laid down by the cold air and the weight of what had burned, turning the light in that direction the specific color of ash and consequence. The wind brought it to him in intervals. Each time it arrived it tasted the same. Iron and char and the sweetness underneath that was not wood. Each time he noted it and filed it and let it be information.

The orc formation pressed forward in silence.

A gust came off the field and drove the smoke from the lower ring into his face again, full and sustained, and he let it come. The taste of it sat on his tongue. The smell of it filled the back of his throat. Somewhere in the lower ring the Hall of the Fallen was still burning, and the assessment team could not go in for four hours, and what those hours contained was something he had filed and would not open until there was time for opening.

The horde was on the march. The gate was sealed. The wall was manned.

He looked at the field.

He did not turn.
