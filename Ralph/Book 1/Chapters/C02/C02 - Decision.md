DECISION RESOLUTION for C02:

Option 1: Burn the cart and keep the gate sealed.

Stoneveil does not open the gate. He orders the cart burned to clear the track for future military use only. The civilians outside are sacrificed to preserve the defense.

This decision has been made and is reflected in the current draft. Do NOT output DECISION REQUIRED for this choice again.

ADDITIONAL DIRECTION (apply to this pass):

1. NAMED COST: Maren, the bucket-line widow with the red braid from forge row. She is outside the gate. Stoneveil recognizes her. He still says "Burn it." The reader feels the weight.

2. VARY AUTHORITY: Do not repeat the same pressure pattern. Vary how Stoneveil exerts command: a look, cold math, quiet threat, a tap on a soldier's elbow, silence that ends the argument.

3. ENDING: "He did not turn." — the cart smoke rising into his face while he keeps his eyes on the field. Inevitable, not cinematic.

4. WORD COUNT: This chapter MUST reach at least 3,500 words. Do not compress.
