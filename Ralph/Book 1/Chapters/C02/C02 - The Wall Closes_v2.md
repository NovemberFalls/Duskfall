Stoneveil moved before the dust cleared.

“Bar the inner gate,” he said. “Seal the firewheels. Lock the teeth.”

The command corridor answered with iron. Shouts. The clang of bolts slamming home. The Sundered Gate was a mouth; it did not close on air. It closed on order.

He stepped out onto the ramparts. The wind still carried grit. The blast had blown in from the lower rings, a dull thump that had rolled up the hill and shivered the stone beneath his boots. He had felt it in the soles first, then in the ribs. He had not turned when the shockwave hit. He had turned when the horn sounded.

“Signal line,” he said.

A runner was already on his way. He held a flag in one hand and a brass cone in the other, the old way. If the chains snapped, if the wires burned, if the tubes clogged with smoke, the flag still spoke.

Stoneveil followed the line of the wall to the east. Men in gray coats were moving into position, some still adjusting armor as they jogged. The first wave of reserves climbed the stairs, faces pale and eyes wide. These were not the gate veterans. Too clean. Too quick to look for his approval.

“Left tower. Two extra crossbow squads,” he said to his sergeant.

The man hesitated. “That tower’s already full, Warden.”

“It won’t be in an hour.”

The sergeant saluted and moved. Stoneveil watched him go. He watched the stairwell behind the tower fill, then thin. It always thinned.

A second runner arrived, chest heaving. “Inner ring cordon set, sir. Portcullis down. Steel teeth sealed.”

“Good. Horns?”

“South horn answered. West not yet.”

“Send a runner to West. If they can’t blow it, we do.”

He moved along the wall. A narrow path, built to force men single file, left no room to run without bowing to those who were coming the other way. The stone was slick under his boots. It always was. The forge smoke never left the city. It put oil on everything. In daylight, the walls gleamed black.

He reached the forward parapet and looked down.

The outer ring was a lattice of low roofs and narrow lanes, a braced shoulder around the city’s throat. It was too close to the walls for comfort. That had been the design. Emberfall had grown around the gate and never stopped. Whoever built the first ring had built it as a battering pad—narrow enough to control, solid enough to bleed an enemy before they reached the wall.

Now, a strip of it burned.

Not the whole ring. Not yet. Just a block near the lower ironworks, the smoke rising in a torn column, heat pushing the air sideways. He could not see flames from here, only the dark sheen of thick smoke rolling along the roofline.

“Report?” he asked.

A lieutenant stepped up. “Impact in the lower district, sir. Near Hall of the Fallen. Unknown casualties. A second strike struck the north alley, no fire.”

Stoneveil did not look at the lieutenant. His eyes were on the smoke. It bent in the wind. It carried embers on the gust. The pattern of it was wrong—too steady, too even. It was a siege pattern, not a shop fire.

“Any breach?”

“No. No breach.”

“No breach,” Stoneveil repeated, for the men around him more than for himself.

The horn blew again. This time, West. A long note that slid down into a second. The first call of war had been a shiver. The second was a warning. The third was command.

“Signal the inner corridors,” he said. “All units to wartime rotations. Kitchen shifts halve. Iron crews to the wall. Engineers to the ramp.”

The lieutenant nodded, and a runner took it.

He walked to the forward sightline and turned to the south.

There, the land dropped away, and the Blackroot Scar spread out, a broad cut of earth and old siege lines that led to the open plain. The plain had been empty yesterday. It was not empty now.

At first it was just movement. Smoke columns in the distance, the dull shape of things that were not trees, the flat line of tents against the horizon. Then the banners lifted, and he saw colors—iron-red, mud-black, bone-white. Orc cloth. Goblin rags. The density of it was wrong. A raid didn’t raise that many standards. A raid didn’t set that many fires.

He saw them assemble.

To his right, a young officer cursed under his breath. He had the sense to keep the sound quiet. Stoneveil didn’t acknowledge it.

“Range?” he asked.

“Out of bolt range, sir. But the engines… hard to say. We’re watching.”

He could see the engines now. Low frames. Cranks. Long arms with slings. Goblin work. It always looked like scrap until it started throwing.

“Have the counterweights set,” he said. “Tell the engineers: lower angle. It’s too high for the first volleys.”

“They’re not ready.”

“They will be.”

Stoneveil went along the parapet. The men followed without argument. On the wall, it was his voice, his pace, his presence. The line held because he held it.

He stopped at the center tower and looked out again. The orc line was solid now, a dark seam on the ground. Behind it, more movement. Ladders. Bundled wood. Drum lines. The goblin crews were already measuring with braided rope.

A siege. Not a raid. Not probing. Not harassment. He had known the distinction the moment the blast hit. The weight of it in the air. The timing. The follow-up. The silence after. A raid shouted. A siege prepared.

He looked down to the outer ring again. Men were running along the roofs with buckets. Others dragged injured across a walkway. A cordon of legionnaires began pushing civilians back toward the inner corridor. It moved like a muscle tightening, inexorable and not gentle.

“Warden,” a voice said behind him.

He turned. Sergeant Kellen had climbed with a slate and a courier.

“Reports from lower ring,” Kellen said. “Casualty count unknown. Hall of the Fallen struck. Healer quarter… damaged.”

Stoneveil nodded once. “Tell them to seal the lanes. Keep the civilians moving. No one on the streets.”

Kellen hesitated. “They’re trying to get the wounded out.”

“Wounded move with the line. Civilians do not cross the open. Hold them inside.”

“The Hall is inside.”

“They still don’t cross the open. If the fireteam has to leave them, they leave them.”

Kellen’s jaw tightened. He nodded and went. The courier followed.

Stoneveil kept his face still. That was the rule. The order was correct. Lanes were lines of fire once the second volley began. You did not keep a lane open for a handful of wounded when a volley could take a hundred. Not today. Not with this enemy.

He walked to the far end of the parapet and stopped at a staircase that led down to the inner command corridor. The corridor ran along the inside of the wall, a stone throat for orders.

He listened. The wall was alive. The sounds of men moving on stone, steel on steel, shouted counts. The horns now came in a steady pattern, calling all companies to their sections.

“Signal to the inner ring,” he said to the scribe stationed by the corridor. “This is full siege. All stockpiles to the gate.”

The scribe did not blink. He wrote fast. The message would go through tubes to the inner ring and over to the Emberheart. Lord Commander Blackthorn would read it with a clean hand.

Stoneveil took the stair down. The corridor below was narrow, lit by wall lamps that flickered with the movement. He passed a wall map with pins that marked squads and towers. It was already out of date. He didn’t stop.

A runner met him. “Sir. East ramp mortar crew not answering.”

“Send a second runner. If no response, reassign them to tower three. We cannot spare a crew on a jammed tube.”

The runner ran.

He met Captain Ales. “What’s the count?”

“Gate garrison at nine hundred, sir. Full reserves from the inner ring are in motion. The foundry crews are coming up.”

“Food?”

“Dry ration only. The cooks have been moved.”

“Good.”

He turned and went back up to the wall. A blast cracked again, this one closer. Dust rained from the parapet. The stone shook under his feet. A chorus of startled voices rose, then fell away as he stepped into view.

“Hold.”

They held. That was all it took.

The blast had hit the outer ring again. Another column of smoke rose, closer to the wall now. It carried a smell that cut through the forge smoke. Not charcoal. Not pitch. Old wood. Dry. The smell of fire in a place that had already burned.

His mouth went dry. Not from fear. From the taste of it, sharp and familiar, lodged in the back of his throat.

He saw it. For a second, the wall was not here. The ring below was not roof and alley. It was a street in the Anvil District, orange light in the windows, and a line of fire moving down the row, the wind carrying the flames faster than the men could run.

A child’s scream, cut off.

He blinked. The wall came back. The smoke was here, now. He swallowed the taste and let it go.

“Sir?” a soldier asked.

Stoneveil nodded without looking at him. “Position.”

They went.

He moved to the forward parapet again. The orc line had advanced. He could see faces now, the dull shine of tusk and iron. They carried shields. They moved in rough blocks, no tight formations, but not a rabble. A wave held by force of will.

Goblins darted between them, low to the ground, pulling wheeled frames. They were shouting to each other in a fast, clattering tongue. He couldn’t hear the words at this distance, but he knew the rhythm. Range calls. Timing. They were setting for the next strike.

A goblin climbed onto an engine, raised a hand, and snapped it down. The arm swung. A stone rose into the air, a dark arc against the white cloud.

“Down!” Stoneveil shouted.

The men dropped to the stone. The rock sailed over the wall and crashed somewhere inside, the sound a deep thunder that rolled under the city.

He rose first. The men rose with him.

“Counterfire.”

The engineer crews answered. The great arms on the wall lifted, angles set lower now. The counterweights dropped. Stone rose. The first volley went out. Two stones fell short. One struck the ground in the plain and sent a spray of dirt. The third hit a goblin engine and broke it in half.

A cheer started. Stoneveil cut it with a look.

“Reload. Faster.”

The crews moved. The arms rose again.

He walked toward the south tower and climbed. From here, he could see over the outer ring to the open plain. The orcs were forming lines. The goblins were pulling the next stone into the sling. There were more engines than he wanted to count. The line of banners stretched too far. He did the count anyway.

“Six banners,” he said. “Ten engines. No. Twelve.”

The lieutenant beside him counted too, jaw tight. “That’s the Ironclaw.”

Stoneveil did not answer. He didn’t need to.

He looked along the wall. The towers were filling. The men were steady. The horns were in rhythm now, a pulse of iron and breath.

“Warden!” a shout below.

He turned. Another runner, this one wearing the soot of the lower ring.

“Orders, sir. Lower ring wants to send a rescue team to the Hall.”

Stoneveil looked down to the inner corridor. The line there was already moving. Men with stretchers. Men with buckets. It would look like mercy. It would turn into a slaughter.

“Negative,” he said.

The runner swallowed. “They’re asking for—”

“Negative.”

The runner nodded and ran. The corridor continued to move, but it was now a line of steel, not a flow of civilians. The line was right. The cost was not his to explain.

He watched a group of civilians at the far end of the corridor, pressed against a gate, trying to push through. A sergeant held them back. She was smaller than they were, but she didn’t yield.

Stoneveil turned back to the wall.

The second volley came. Stones slammed into the outer ring, breaking roofs, blasting walls, turning alleys into trenches. One struck a block close to the Hall of the Fallen. He saw the roof buckle, then collapse. He did not look longer than he had to.

“Angle lower,” he said to the engineers. “Target the engines. Not the line. Break their teeth.”

They adjusted.

A runner came in. “Sir. Inner ring reports moving the civilians from the lower districts. But the east stairs are blocked by debris.”

“Get engineers there. Clear it. Use the blackpowder if you have to.”

“If we blow that stair, we’ll—”

“We need that stair. Clear it.”

The runner saluted and went.

The engines on the wall fired again. One stone landed in the plain. Another hit the edge of a goblin crew and rolled, crushing the frame. The goblins scattered, quick and low. Orcs pushed forward, dragging the engine out of the way.

Stoneveil watched their movement. The orcs were willing to carry the engines themselves. That meant their command was strong. That meant the siege would not falter from early losses. It was not a raid. It was a hold.

He moved along the parapet to the western tower. There, the view was clear of smoke, and he could see the northern ridge. There were more flags, more movement. The siege ring was closing from multiple lines. They would push in from the south, flank from the north, and close around the outer ring until the walls were their only option.

The Warden’s wall was not only a wall. It was a trap. If the enemy could force the defenders to the wall and keep them there, the city would bleed out behind him. That was how sieges killed. Not with the breach. With the waiting.

Stoneveil traced the line of engines in his head. He counted the distances. He saw where the goblins were placing their ranges. He judged their angle. He judged his own.

He had given his orders. He would not revisit them. That was the line between command and doubt. Doubt had no place on a wall.

He turned to a young officer. “Where’s the aerial watchers?”

“Down, sir. The wind is wrong. Too much smoke.”

“Then they stay down.”

“Sir. Scouts from the outer ring request permission to—”

“Denied.”

He looked out again. The orc banners dipped. A drum sounded from the plain. It was a low sound, not the high war-horns of the city. It rolled under the sound of the engines and made the stone feel heavier.

He watched the line advance. It was slow and deliberate. They were closing the distance under the cover of their own engines. Goblins sprinted ahead, low and fast. They had shields made of scavenged iron, held at a slant to catch bolts. They were not brave. They were used to being hit.

“Crossbows, hold,” he said.

The archers held, knuckles white on the strings. They would want to fire. The target was right there. He forced them to wait.

“Let them come,” he said.

He needed them close. Bolts were precious. The foundry would keep the bolts coming, but not fast enough. He could not spend them on the first wave.

The goblins reached the outer ring and vanished into the alleys. The orc line reached the outer edge and slowed. They did not charge. They started to build. They laid down boards, stacks of planks, heaps of stone. They set shields in front to make a low wall. They were not here to die in a rush. They were here to press forward in layers.

Stoneveil felt the shift. He’d seen it before. Not here. Not in Emberfall. But at Ashgate. The moment a battle turned into a grind. A siege had a rhythm. He felt it settle into his bones.

“West tower, one extra ironbow,” he said.

The officer looked uncertain. “We’re thin on ironbows.”

“We’re thinner on time.”

The order went. The ironbow team moved, dragging the heavy weapon along the wall. The ironbows were old siege counter weapons. They fired thick bolts that could punch through shield walls and split ladders. There were only four. He was placing the second.

A runner arrived, breathless. “Sir. Civilians are pushing at the inner gate. They want to leave the lower ring.”

“They won’t. Order the gate sealed. Any who try to force it are to be turned back.”

The runner hesitated. “With force, sir?”

“With force.”

He did not say “if needed.” The line could not include if. If was for officers at tables. On a wall, there was only yes or no.

He went back to the forward parapet and watched the orcs set their first ladders against the outer ring, not the wall. They were taking the ring one block at a time, using it as cover. That meant the fight would not be here yet. It would be inside the outer ring, where his men were not, and his civilians were.

He could not stop that. Not with the wall. Not with his numbers. He could only hold the gate and let the outer ring be bled. He had built those streets to kill enemy lines. He was about to watch them kill his own.

He did not flinch. He did not speak it. He just moved.

“Send word to the outer ring captains,” he said to the signaler. “Hold their block. Do not give ground without contact. If you pull back, burn what you can’t take. Do not let them use the rooflines.”

The signaler nodded and worked the flag. The signal was fast. It would be understood. The men in the outer ring knew what he was asking of them. They knew it might be a death sentence. They would follow anyway.

He felt another blast, this one closer still. Dust rained in a thin sheet. He wiped it from his brow and tasted iron. It was grit. Not blood. Not yet.

The smoke grew darker. He could smell pitch now. The goblins were firing incendiaries. The smell layered over the forge smoke and cut into the back of his mouth. It was an old smell. The same as the Anvil. The same as the night he watched the district burn and never turned away.

A hand touched his arm. Captain Ales. “Sir. The south tower is taking fire.”

Stoneveil nodded and moved.

The south tower’s parapet was cracked. A stone had hit the outer edge and sheared off a chunk of wall. Two men were down. One had a broken leg, the bone white against the black stone. The other was burned across the face, his eyes closed, his mouth open. A medic was already there, tying a cloth over the leg.

Stoneveil knelt by the burned man. The eyes fluttered. The man recognized him. He tried to rise.

“Stay,” Stoneveil said.

The man obeyed.

Stoneveil rose and looked out.

The orc line had moved again. Their banners were closer now. The goblin crews were setting a new range. This time, it looked higher. They had adjusted for the counterfire. Their shots would go over the wall and into the inner ring. The city would burn from inside.

He took a breath. He held it. Then he let it go.

“Send a runner to the inner ring,” he said. “Buckets to the Emberheart. Every roof. We’re about to get hit.”

The runner ran.

Stoneveil moved back to the central tower. He climbed the ladder to the upper platform and looked down at the city behind him.

Emberfall was a furnace city. It never slept. Smoke rose from the forges even now, though the bellows had been muted and the fires banked. The streets were narrow, the roofs close. A fire from above would run fast.

He saw civilians moving between buildings, heads down, carrying bundles. Some were already at the inner ring gates, waiting for orders. He saw a mother pull a child behind her into a doorway as a stone screamed overhead.

He did not have time to stop. He did not have the right to intervene. This was not about that. It was about the line.

Another runner arrived, younger than the last. “Sir. There’s a message from the Emberheart. Lord Commander Blackthorn requests a count.”

Stoneveil looked at him. “Tell him we are under full siege. Tell him the outer ring is engaged. Tell him we can hold the gate. Tell him I need more bolts.”

The runner nodded and ran.

He stayed on the platform, the wind cutting at his face. He watched the orc line advance in a measured line. He watched the goblin crews fire in rhythmic bursts. He watched his wall crews respond with counterfire and crossbows. He watched the outer ring begin to burn.

A shout rose from below. A ladder was being raised against the outer ring walls, not the gate. Orcs climbed over the parapet of a low roof, swinging crude axes. A handful of defenders met them. The fight was too far to hear, but he could read the movement. The defenders were outnumbered. They would fall back. They would do it in good order if they could.

He turned. “Send a detachment to the lower ring—”

He stopped. The words were already wrong. The detachment would die. It would open a gap on the wall for a handful of men. It would be a trade that would not hold.

He lowered his voice. “No. Keep the detachment. Hold the gate.”

The soldier at his side did not react. He did not need to. The order had been heard.

The stone hit again. This time the impact was in the city behind him. A tall column of dust and wood splinters rose from the inner ring. A scream cut through the air, sharp and brief.

Stoneveil’s jaw tightened. He did not move.

A new horn blew. The call to the inner ring. The city’s voice, answering the wall. It was a lower pitch, a longer sound. It told him the inner ring had heard. It told him they were bracing.

He turned to his sergeant. “We will not be relieved today.”

“Yes, sir.”

“Tell the men. No relief. Shifts only. No sleep on the wall.”

The sergeant nodded. He would deliver it without commentary.

He looked out again. The orc banners advanced. The gap between the enemy and the outer ring narrowed to a handful of bowshots. The orcs raised their shields and began to move in a tighter line. The goblins broke and moved to the flanks, their engines rolling with them. The drums beat faster.

Stoneveil lifted his hand. “Crossbows. On my mark.”

The men readied. Strings creaked. Bolts slid into place.

“Hold.”

The orcs reached the first outer ring barricade and slowed. They had to climb now. They had to step over broken wood and stone.

“Mark.”

The crossbows fired. The first line of bolts fell into the orc shields. Some hit. Some slipped through. Men fell. Others stepped over them. There was no break in the line.

“Reload.”

The crews moved. The bolts were slower now. The ironbows fired, heavy and deep. One bolt struck a ladder and shattered it. Orcs fell from it, and two did not rise. Another bolt struck a shield and split it. The orc behind it took the bolt through the chest.

The line did not stop.

“Hold,” Stoneveil said.

He moved along the parapet to keep his line steady. He placed himself where the men could see him. He did not shout. He did not need to. His presence was enough.

Below, the outer ring was now a battlefield. Smoke rose from three points. The rooflines were broken. The defenders were falling back from block to block. The orcs pushed in. Goblins slipped through gaps and set fire to stores. The streets became a maze of flame and shadow.

Stoneveil did not look away. He could not afford to. Every movement below told him where the next push would come.

A runner arrived with a slip of slate. “From the outer ring, sir. Captain Harlan reports his line is buckling. He requests permission to withdraw.”

Stoneveil read the slate. Harlan had held the outer ring for years. He was not a man who requested a retreat lightly.

“Permission granted to fall back to line two,” Stoneveil said. “Tell him: burn the north block as he goes. Deny them roofline.”

The runner nodded and ran. The order had been made. The cost accepted.

He stood at the parapet and watched the north block catch fire as Harlan’s men pulled back. The flames ate into the roofline. The orcs slowed, then diverted around. The path had been denied.

Stoneveil exhaled.

The air smelled of pitch now. The smoke had thickened. It pressed against his eyes, making them sting. He blinked and felt grit under his lids.

“Warden,” Captain Ales said. “We’ve got a signal from the lower ring. They say the Hall is—”

Stoneveil raised a hand. “I know.”

Ales hesitated. “They’re asking for permission to send healers to the outer ring. They say they’ll go under cover.”

Stoneveil did not answer right away. He watched the orcs move. He watched the goblins set their engines. He watched the men on his wall.

“No,” he said.

Ales was silent.

“They won’t survive the walk,” Stoneveil added. “And their going opens the line. No.”

Ales nodded and left.

Stoneveil turned back to the wall. The orc line was now within clear bolt range. The goblins were firing in a higher arc, their stones landing in the inner ring. The city behind him was starting to burn.

He made the next call. “All fire to engines. Ignore the line. Break their teeth.”

He would bleed their machine. The orcs would climb. The goblins would burn. He could not stop the climb, but he could slow the burn. He could keep the wall from being blind.

The crews adjusted. The next volley arced and struck a goblin engine. It crumpled. Goblins scattered. A second engine was hit, the sling torn from its arm. The third survived and fired.

A stone hit the inner ring. The blast shook the parapet. Stoneveil felt it in his bones.

He took a breath. The wall was not failing. The men were not breaking. It was enough. It would have to be.

He moved along the parapet one more time, checking each tower. Men were still in position. The engineers still worked. The crossbow squads were sweating and bleeding from their fingers.

He saw one of the men falter, head down, hands shaking. Stoneveil stepped to him.

“Look at me,” he said.

The man lifted his eyes.

“Hold the line,” Stoneveil said.

The man nodded. He straightened. He loaded his bow.

Stoneveil moved on.

He climbed to the highest point of the gate tower and looked out over the wall.

The siege had begun.

The orc line was now a steady, advancing wave. The goblin crews moved between them, their engines firing, their voices quick and sharp. The outer ring burned. The inner ring braced. The city tightened around the gate.

Stoneveil watched the first organized advance close on the wall.

He did not speak.

He did not allow himself to.

He stood in the smoke and the grit and watched the enemy come.
