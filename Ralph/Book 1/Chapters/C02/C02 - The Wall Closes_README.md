# C02 - The Wall Closes — Edit History & Rationale

This README captures the major edits and decisions that shaped C02 across iterations. It documents *what changed and why* so future chapters start with these lessons baked in.

## Iteration Log

### Pass 1 (original ralphloop, no upgrades)
**Result:** Competent military vignette. Procedural. Reads like an operations log.
**Problems identified:**
- No emotional tether — Stoneveil is pure duty calculus
- Everything happens in the same minute — no pacing variation
- "He did not" construction used 12+ times
- 52 paragraphs start with "He" (36%)
- Single emotional register — relentlessly grim with no contrast
- Civilians "denied" is abstract, not felt
- No previous chapter fed — model had no sense of reader's emotional state from C01
- No scene architecture guidance

### Pass 2 (upgraded ralphloop: Scene Architecture + previous chapter + revision lessons)
**Result:** Significant improvement. Hit DECISION REQUIRED — moral gray moment worked.
**Improvements:**
- Quiet opening (smoke motif — "crawled along the stone like a thing that knew the way")
- Anvil memory tied to smell, not just name-dropping. Real interior engine.
- "Burn it" decision is concrete, immediate, not abstract "denied"
- Isolde functions as a human mirror — uses his first name once (rare, earned)
- Time anchors present ("By midafternoon...")
- Sensory channels expanded (taste of iron, smell of soap/tallow, vibration through boots)

### Pass 3 (with Decision resolved: burn the cart, keep gate sealed)
**Result:** Landed at 2,117 words (under target). Quality up but needs expansion.
**What worked:**
- Smoke motif strong throughout
- Anvil smell-memory breathes naturally, not forced
- "Burn it" + shared silence is the chapter's spine
- Tactical clarity maintained while prose sharpened
- "The day was past for it" (re: salutes) — excellent micro-detail
- "He'd expected... It hadn't been. That was worse." — real interiority

**What still needed fixing:**
1. Named cost missing — civilians faceless
2. "Make it forty / Make it faster" catchphrase repetition
3. Ending clean but generic ("The siege had begun")
4. Word count under target (2,117 vs 3,000-5,000)

### Pass 4 (FINAL — named cost + varied authority + sharper ending + Decision file updated)
**Result:** Publishable-tier. Stands shoulder-to-shoulder with C01. ~2,400 words.
**What landed:**
- **Maren** (forge-row widow, red braid, pump-handle image) — named cost perfectly executed. Arrives indirectly via "bucket-line folk" → runner confirms. Mundane specificity that hits like a spear.
- **"Burn it"** is now iconic hinge: delayed (Stoneveil watches, breathes), lieutenant's "Warden—" hangs, then "Burn it" repeated without theatrics. Paid off with cart smoke in his face at the end.
- **Anvil memory**: "The images came without sound" — killer line. Method of stepping over, not pushing away, is psychologically real.
- **Authority without catchphrases**: parapet tap, elbow tap, strap catch, hand lift, silence — all different command tells. No repeated verbal patterns.
- **Ending**: "He did not turn." Three words. Judgment sealed in wax. The cart smoke rising into his face while he keeps eyes on the field. Perfect.

**Remaining issues (human review):**
1. **"sternum"** (line 23 area) — too clinical. Should be "chest" or "ribs." Grimdark prose uses body words readers feel, not anatomy textbook.
2. **"Report to Captain Veyne"** — Isolde is standing right beside him. He would turn to her directly, not send a runner to find her.
3. **Double hand/arm gesture** — "held up a hand" to silence the runner, then "lifted his arm" to signal the line. Back-to-back with no lowering. Needs one varied (nod, look, word) or explicit lowering between.
4. **Isolde appearance** — described as "hair damp at the temples" but her character bible says short-cropped, silver-streaked hair with iron-plated armor. Model didn't have her NPC file.
5. **Word count** — still at ~2,400. Target was 3,500+.

**Fix applied to pipeline**: NPC Leaders/Humans.md + Character Tracker now added to WORLD_FILES. Scene Architecture updated with character continuity rules.

**Final audit verdict:**
- C01 wins on intimacy (Horus + domestic-to-disaster)
- C02 wins on grim authority + thematic cohesion + motif work
- Essentially tied. Which is "superior" depends on reader preference: heartbreak (C01) vs command dread / moral injury (C02)
- "If forced to pick best chapter craft: C02 edges it by a hair because the motif work is cleaner and the ending is surgical."

## Pipeline Changes That Produced This Result
1. **Scene Architecture guide** (`World/08 - Scene Architecture.md`) — scene type variety, contrast arcs, knife beat, named cost, pacing rules, prose craft rules
2. **Previous chapter context** — C01 v5_4 fed so the model knew reader's emotional state
3. **Revision lessons** — C01 README fed as craft guide
4. **Decision file as iteration vehicle** — specific, actionable direction for each pass (named cost, varied authority, ending sharpness, word count)

## Key Lessons for Future Chapters
- **Named cost > abstract cost**: "Thirty civilians" means nothing. "Maren, who ran the bucket line at the south well" means everything.
- **Interior engine must be present-tense**: The Anvil works when it's triggered by a smell NOW, not referenced as backstory.
- **Catchphrases kill authority**: Vary how a commander exerts pressure. Same pattern twice = character. Three times = tic.
- **Previous chapter context is essential**: The model produced contrast and earned its opening only after receiving C01.
- **Scene Architecture guide works**: The knife beat, sensory channels, and contrast requirements all showed up in the output.
- **Motif closure**: A recurring image (smoke, smell) introduced early and paid off at the end creates structural satisfaction.
- **Ending economy**: Three words can carry more weight than three paragraphs. "He did not turn." > any cinematic sweep.
- **Decision files compound**: Each pass's specific direction builds on the last. The model gets better when it knows exactly what you want fixed.
