**C05 — The Grind**

The Hall of the Fallen never had time to cool.

Kael Veyne moved through heat and smoke and the damp breath of too many bodies. Lanterns hissed on hooks. The stone floor held old blood that no one could scrub away. The air tasted of iron and bile.

He washed his hands. He dried them on a linen that was already stained. He did it anyway. The habit mattered.

The first man in the line had a split scalp. The second had no leg. The third clutched his chest with a look that said his ribs were not what hurt. Kael didn't ask names. He asked faith.

"Do you still believe?" he asked the boy with the split scalp.

The boy nodded. It might have been a lie. It might have been shock.

Kael pressed his palm to the boy's forehead. He spoke the words he had spoken a hundred times before the siege. They came out steady. They had weight. They had to.

"Order, grant you peace."

He moved on.

The legless man had already fainted. A healer knelt at his side, fingers buried in meat, trying to stop the bleeding. Kael put his hand on the man's shoulder and said the words for the dead. He didn't wait to see if the man stayed alive.

By midday, the line never ended. It didn't move like a line. It spilled. The doors opened and the wounded came in waves. The worst of them were carried. The rest crawled. Some limped in with their own arms as crutches, a broken spear or a friend's body to keep them upright. Kael did not look away.

He walked. He prayed. He bled time.

A lieutenant stumbled in with his face burned black and his eyes two wet holes. His mouth worked. No sound came out. Kael knelt and spoke the rite for those who cannot speak. The man clutched his sleeve. Kael held his wrist until the grip slackened.

"Go in order," Kael whispered, even as the man died.

There was no time for grief. There was no room for it.

The Hall's long tables were full. The floor had bodies now, laid side by side like billets of wood. Healers moved among them with knives and needle. The ones with nothing to offer moved slower. The ones with something to do moved fast. Kael watched them, grateful for their work, ashamed he could not do it.

A young woman with a shattered arm met his eyes. "Is Tyr watching?" she asked.

Kael was not supposed to hesitate. He had been trained for this. He had stood in the Warded Archive while older priests questioned heretics. He had watched a man burn for false doctrine and felt the rightness of it.

He did not feel rightness now. He felt the weight of her question.

"He is," Kael said. He placed his hand on her head and said the blessing. The words did not change the bone.

He moved on.

The next hours were blood and smoke and the names of the dead. Kael heard them from the lips of others, and sometimes he spoke them himself. The rites did not heal wounds. The rites did not stop bleeding. They did not carry men off the tables. The rites did not keep the doors from opening again.

There was a rhythm to it, a grind. Kael had always respected rhythm. He found it in the chants. He found it in the marches of the faithful in the Emberheart.

This rhythm was teeth on stone.

He washed his hands again. The water ran red. He did not know if it was all his.

A bell rang in the Cathedral corridor. It was not the time for bells. It meant something new. Kael stepped out into the passage. Stone. Shadow. The smell of incense clung to the pillars like old habit.

A runner skidded to a halt, face smeared with ash. "Inquisitor Adept," he said. "The west breach is holding, but the wounded are coming faster than we can move them."

Kael nodded. "Send them to the Hall."

"They already are."

Kael watched the runner go. He stood for a moment in the corridor and let the weight settle. The Cathedral had been built for quiet. The quiet was gone.

He took the side stair and climbed to the high window above the Hall. The opening was narrow, made for light, not for watching. He had to lean out to see.

He saw the wall.

The Sundered Gate was a smear of black stone under a sky of smoke. Men moved along its top like insects. He could see the flags. He could see the motion. He could not hear the fighting from here, but he could feel it. The city trembled under each strike.

Kael's eyes searched without his permission. He knew where to look. He had done it yesterday. He had done it this morning. He looked for the figure that was too young for the line.

Edric was there.

He was a small shape at this distance. A helmet. A spear. A head turning. Kael could not tell if it was his nephew by face. He could tell by the way he held himself. Edric was too upright. Too rigid. Trying to be iron. Not iron yet.

Kael's hands tightened on the stone edge.

He could go to the wall. He could pull rank. He could take Edric down and assign him elsewhere. There were plenty of duties in the Hall. Carrying water. Holding men down for stitches. It would be safer.

He thought of the rules. He thought of the last time he had used his position to bend an assignment for Edric in the first place. He had believed he was doing right by his family. He had believed proximity to the Warden would make the boy into steel. He had not believed the wall would become a grinder.

He exhaled. The breath was short.

If he pulled Edric now, he would be doing what he condemned in others. He would be making a private exception in a public war. He would be choosing blood over order.

He closed his eyes for a moment and felt the edges of the prayer he would have offered. It did not come.

Kael let his hands drop. He stepped back from the window.

Down in the Hall, a healer called his name. He returned to the grind.

A man with an arrow through his neck was shaking. Kael held his head so the healer could pull. The healer yanked. Blood sprayed across Kael's sleeve. The man choked and died. Kael said the rite. His voice was steady. It had to be.

The next man stared at him with a look that asked why. Kael had no answer.

The hours pushed into evening. The candles burned lower. The lanterns were re-lit. Healers fell asleep standing, snapped awake, kept working. Kael moved among them, a quiet presence with prayers on his lips and too little in his hands.

A roar of horns rolled through the city. It was not the enemy. It was a signal from the walls. Kael looked up, reflex, as if he could see the answer in the rafters. There was only smoke and shadow.

The doors opened again. This wave came with a rank of discipline. Men in Legion armor carried stretchers in a line. A commander at their head was tall, broad, and not looking at Kael when he entered. Stoneveil.

Warden Alric Stoneveil did not enter the Hall. He stayed in the corridor, just inside the arch. He wore soot and grime like a cloak. His jaw was set. His gaze measured the room, the bodies, the healers, the number of hands. He did not greet Kael. He did not need to.

Kael approached him.

"Warden."

Stoneveil's eyes flicked to him. "Inquisitor."

"They need more hands," Kael said.

"They need better hands," Stoneveil said. His voice was flat.

Kael followed his gaze to the stretchers. "What happened at the west breach?"

"Heat and bodies," Stoneveil said. "We held. For now."

A healer rushed past them with a bowl of water that was too red to be water. Stoneveil did not look. He pointed toward a stretcher where a man gasped with an opened abdomen. "Who is that?"

"Legionnaire, I think," Kael said.

Stoneveil stepped closer. He looked at the man for a second, then at the healer nearest him. "That one goes to the back."

The healer hesitated. "Warden—"

"His gut is out. His pulse is gone," Stoneveil said. "Save the ones you can."

Kael watched the man's eyes as he was rolled to the back. They followed the healer's hands, then went distant. Kael put his palm to the man's head as he passed and said the rite under his breath.

Stoneveil didn't hear or didn't care. He moved to the next stretcher. He tapped two men on the shoulder, told them to stand, told them to return to the wall. They protested. One had blood running down his arm. The other had a limp. Stoneveil told them to go anyway. They went.

Kael felt the words rise in his throat. He swallowed them down.

"Is this the line you draw now?" Kael asked quietly.

Stoneveil turned his head. His eyes were on Kael without expression. "This is the line I have to hold," he said.

Kael held the gaze. He saw a man who had drawn too many lines. He saw a man who had not flinched from any of them.

Stoneveil moved on. He never touched a wounded man's hand. He never spoke a name. He did not have time.

Kael turned back into the Hall. He worked until the Warden left.

The grind continued. Kael counted breaths. He counted steps. He counted the names he could not remember.

He tried to pray between tasks. The prayers were full of gaps.

"Order guide their hands," he whispered over a healer who was stitching skin to skin with blood running down her wrist. "Order hold this roof," he whispered under the rafters as they shook.

He felt the words crack at the edges. He kept saying them.

At dusk, the hall was full of quiet for a moment. Not peace. Just exhaustion. Men slept. Healers leaned against tables. Kael sat on the edge of a bench, hands on his knees. He could not sit still long. The need to move itched under his skin.

He stood. He walked down the line of bodies and paused at a young man with a bandaged head. The boy's eyes opened. "Is it night?" he asked.

"Almost," Kael said.

"Did we hold?"

"For now."

The boy closed his eyes. "Tell my mother I did."

Kael felt something tighten inside him. "I will," he said.

He had no idea if the mother was alive. He said it anyway. He had always believed words mattered. He believed it now because it was all he had.

The night came. The Hall never stopped. The wounded kept coming, but slower. The fighting on the wall had settled into a steady rumble, distant, relentless. Kael could feel it through the stone.

He went to the basin again. He washed his hands. He watched the water run clear. It wasn't.

A messenger came from the Cathedral corridor. "Inquisitor Adept," she said. "High Inquisitor requests your presence."

Kael set down the cloth. He did not want to go. He did.

High Inquisitor Varian Marrow stood in the corridor as if he had been carved there. His robes were clean. His hands were unmarked.

"You are needed in the Archive," Marrow said. His voice was calm. "There are matters of integrity."

Kael looked past him to the Hall. "There are matters of blood."

Marrow's eyes narrowed. "Order is more than blood, Kael."

Kael did not answer. He nodded once. He moved around Marrow and back toward the Hall instead of toward the Archive.

Marrow caught his arm. "Do not let the siege become your excuse," he said.

Kael looked at the hand on his sleeve. He did not pull away. "It is not an excuse," he said. "It is the siege."

Marrow released him. "You will report before dawn."

Kael nodded again. He did not promise. He went back to the Hall.

A man screamed. A healer held him down. Kael took the man's hand. The man bit his wrist. Kael did not pull away.

"Order grant you peace," Kael said. His voice was a whisper. "Order grant you..."

The man spat blood and passed out. Kael's wrist throbbed. He pressed his hand to the bite, feeling the wet.

He moved on.

At some point, he looked out from the same narrow window. The wall was still there. The sky was red with fires. The men on the wall were hunched shadows in the glow. He looked for Edric. He did not see him. He waited longer. He saw a figure with a spear and a stance that was too rigid. He could not tell.

He told himself that not knowing was better than knowing. He did not believe it.

He went back inside. He found a boy no older than Edric with a shattered jaw. The boy's eyes followed him. Kael leaned close. "Do you know the words?" he asked.

The boy moved his lips around blood. Kael heard nothing. He said the rite anyway. It was the same rite. It did not feel the same.

Kael's thoughts went in tight circles. Faith. Function. Order. Blood. The prayers did not stop the bleeding. The rites did not keep the walls. Yet men asked for them. Healers asked for them. The dead were laid out and waited on him. If he left, no one else would speak the words.

He could not call his work useless while his hands were on a dying man's head.

He returned to the center of the Hall. He stood between the tables, between the moans and the coughs and the quiet. He lifted his hands. He began the prayer he had used to begin every day.

"By the measure of the Law, we stand," he said. "By the light of—"

His voice caught. He breathed in. The air was smoke and blood. He tried again.

"By the light of—"

The words did not come.

He stood in the Hall of the Fallen with his hands raised, mouth open, and no sound. He lowered his hands slowly.

"By the light of—"
