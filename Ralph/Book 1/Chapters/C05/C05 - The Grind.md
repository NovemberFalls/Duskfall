The Hall of the Fallen never slept. It only changed its rhythm.

Midday. The air was hot with bodies and oil-lamps. Not the clean heat of a forge, but the damp, used heat of blood and sweat trapped in stone. Kael Veyne moved between cots. He had done this for years. He could do it blind. He could have done it in the dark, because the work was the same even when sight failed. A hand on a brow. A word over a mouth. A line of blessed ash on a torn bandage. A prayer at the edge of an ear.

“By Tyr’s judgment, you are seen,” he said, voice low, steady. “By Tyr’s hand—”

The boy on the cot to his left rolled his head, eyes half-open, lips cracking. He had lost a leg. The stump was fresh-wrapped, the blood still seeped through the cloth in dark, steady blooms.

Kael did not stop.

“—you are held.”

He pressed his thumb to the boy’s forehead. The boy flinched. Kael lifted his hand. He did not look away.

Another cot. Another mouth. Another breath.

A woman with her arm gone at the shoulder. A man with a red, pulsing line across his neck where the blade had kissed him and then slid. A young soldier with a shattered cheekbone, teeth showing through swollen skin. Kael’s prayers did not change the shape of their wounds. They never had. That wasn’t the point.

He moved with a rhythm that matched the chaos. There were too many to pause. Too many to feel. He had learned to measure each rite in breaths. Three breaths. Five breaths. Ten if the dying were alone.

“By Tyr’s light, you are not alone.”

A groan. A spasm. A shudder. A hand that reached and fell.

He kept moving. The wounded came in waves, carried on doors ripped from hinges, on ladders, on shoulders. The siege had settled into its grind. Day Three. The fighting was not a single clash now. It was a river that did not stop.

Kael’s robe was dark at the hem. Blood splashed his cuffs. He did not mind. Tyr did not mind. The Inquisition taught that purity was intention, not cloth.

A runner from the gates stumbled into the Hall, helmet missing, hair matted with soot. “More coming,” he said. “Four carts. Behind them—” He coughed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “We’re using the north arch now. South is blocked.”

Kael nodded. “Tell the apothecary.”

The runner stared at him for a moment, face blank, then pushed back into the press.

Kael turned and walked toward the apothecary’s table. Alira had been a healer in the Hall longer than Kael had been an Inquisitor Adept. Her hair was gray now, her hands still quick. She did not look up when he approached. She was tightening a bandage around a man’s chest with her teeth, pulling with a surgeon’s brutality.

“North arch,” Kael said.

“I heard.” She tied the knot and shoved the man’s shoulder. “You, sit. You, move.”

She did not need his words. She did not need his rite. He stopped, watched her for two breaths, then moved on.

He could feel the prayer in his mouth before he said it. The same words, same cadence. A liturgy worn smooth by repetition. It was steadiness in a room full of chaos.

The Hall’s stone floor was slick near the center. Blood, water, oil. He stepped carefully. His boots left prints.

He stopped at a cot where a young soldier stared at the ceiling, eyes wide, breath shallow. The boy’s arm was gone below the elbow. The stump had been cauterized. The smell of burned flesh mixed with the sweat and oil.

“Name?” Kael asked.

“Bran,” the boy said.

“Do you fear?”

“Yes.”

Kael nodded once. “Do you believe?”

The boy swallowed. “I don’t know.”

Kael felt the answer in his chest and kept his face smooth. “Faith is not certainty,” he said. “It is what you do with doubt.”

He leaned down. “By Tyr’s judgment, you are seen. By Tyr’s hand, you are held.”

Bran’s lips moved, soundless. Kael did not pretend it mattered. He did not pretend it did not.

He moved on.

The Hall was a river of sound: moans, metal, footsteps, murmurs, shouted names. Above it all, the distant thud of siege engines, the grind of the city under assault. The stone of the Cathedral held the sound and gave it back, a low echo that never stopped.

Kael’s voice was steady when he prayed. It had to be. He had spent years training it, shaping it so it carried calm. He could feel it now, a shield of cadence.

“By Tyr’s judgment…”

He lifted his hand. Ash to brow. A quick line across a bandage.

“—you are seen.”

His eyes flicked left. A man sat upright, pants torn, thigh a ruined mess of muscle and red. He was watching Kael, jaw clenched.

“Do you want the rite?” Kael asked.

The man’s mouth opened. No sound came. He nodded once.

Kael knelt.

“By Tyr’s hand—”

The man coughed blood. A red spray across Kael’s sleeve. Kael did not flinch. He finished the line. He held the man’s gaze until it slid shut.

He could not count how many he had done. He did not want to.

A pressure built behind his eyes. Not tears. Not grief. Something heavier. He pushed it down and focused on the next face. The next breath. The next name.

“Alen.”

“By Tyr’s judgment…”

He was not alone. Other priests moved through the Hall. Not Inquisitors—just brothers and sisters of the Cathedral, their robes hitched up, sleeves tied. They spoke the same rites. Their voices overlapped. It should have been a choir. It sounded like rain on a roof. Constant. Thin. It could not fill the room.

Kael made his way toward the Cathedral corridor. The corridor connected the Hall to the inner sanctum and the north stair. It was quieter there, the air cooler. He stepped into it, pulled his robe away from his mouth to breathe.

A man leaned against the wall, head low, hands pressed together. He was a guardsman, armor stained, a gash across his temple. He did not look up.

Kael paused. “You’re bleeding.”

“I know.”

“Do you need a healer?”

“No.”

Kael listened to his own reply before he said it. “Then go to the wall.”

The guardsman lifted his eyes. They were glassy, but there was something else there too. He nodded and pushed away from the stone.

Kael watched him limp down the corridor, leaving a line of dark drops on the floor. He turned back toward the Hall, then stopped. The sound of a horn came from the walls, low and long. Not a rally. A warning. The rhythm of the siege engines changing, the cadence of the assault shifting. Midday to night. The grind did not stop. It only deepened.

He moved toward the north stair. He needed to see the wall, if only to remind himself what this all was. He needed to see the line, the men, the scale. He needed to see his nephew.

The stair was narrow. He took it two at a time, robe gathered in his hand. The stone was cool against his palm. He could feel the tremor in it, the vibration of the siege outside. It was like standing on a drum.

He emerged into the open air. Smoke hung over the city. The light was dulled, gray with ash. He walked along the parapet toward a gap in the crenellation where he could see the Sundered Gate.

He did not find Edric at first. There were too many men, too many helmets. He scanned the line. Men in iron and leather, backs bent under the weight of their own exhaustion. He saw men he had blessed hours earlier. He saw new faces, fresh from the inner ring, pushed forward to replace the fallen.

Then he saw the boy. Edric was at the center-left, on the second tier of the wall, leaning forward, spear in hand, eyes locked on the field below. His helmet was too big. His jaw was set. He had the posture of a boy pretending to be a man. He was not pretending anymore.

Kael’s throat tightened. He did not call out. He knew the rule. The wall did not care about family. It did not care about names. It cared about bodies and the will to hold.

He could call down. He could tell Edric to come to the Cathedral, to report for a rite, a blessing. He could pull him off the line for an hour, for a moment. He could use his rank. He had done it before for others. He had never done it for his own blood.

His hand tightened on the stone.

He watched Edric thrust the spear down, pull it back, thrust again. He did not see the orc beneath, but he saw the motion. He saw the tremor in Edric’s arm when he pulled it free. He saw the boy’s shoulders lift when he caught his breath.

Kael looked away. He could not give himself the luxury of watching. He could not let his will drift. Duty was the only thing that held him upright. He had said that sentence a thousand times in his mind. It had always sounded like truth. Now it felt like something else—something measured, something cold.

“Father.” A voice behind him.

Kael turned. It was Brother Ellin, a young priest with soot on his face and blood on his hands. “They need you in the Hall,” Ellin said. “The wounded from the north arch are coming in.”

“I’m coming,” Kael said.

He looked once more at Edric. The boy looked up, not toward Kael, but toward the smoke. He did not see his uncle. He did not look for him.

Kael turned and went back down.

The Hall was louder now. The carts had arrived. Men were being lifted out, laid on the stone, moved to cots when available, or to the floor when not. Alira shouted orders. The apothecaries moved like blades, slicing and stitching. The priests’ voices were strained.

Kael stepped into the crush and did not stop moving. He knelt at a man whose hand was crushed. He said the rite, his fingers brushing the man’s forehead. He stood, stepped over a pool of blood, and moved to the next.

He could not keep count. He could not keep names.

A woman grabbed his sleeve. “My son,” she said, eyes wide. “He was with the third line.”

Kael looked at her. “Name?”

“Perrin.”

Kael closed his eyes for a breath. He did not know. He did not have time to find out. He could have asked a runner. He could have sent a brother. He did not.

“Go to the north arch,” he said. “Ask the apothecary. They have the lists.”

She shook her head, a small, violent motion. “Please.”

Kael felt something like rage rise in him, and he crushed it. “Go,” he said, softer. “I will pray for him.”

She let go. She disappeared into the press.

Kael moved on.

He found himself at the triage table. Stoneveil stood there, armor dusted with ash, face unreadable. His cloak was draped across the edge of the table, a map spread beneath it, pinned by a dagger. He was speaking to Alira, his voice low.

“Send these to the north arch,” Stoneveil said, tapping the map. “The outer wall is thinning. We will need them before nightfall.”

“These men can’t walk,” Alira said. She did not look up from her work.

“They can hold a spear,” Stoneveil said.

Kael stopped, the words catching him like a hook. He had seen this before. It was not new. But the bluntness of it in this place, among these bodies, was a new weight.

“They’re bleeding,” Alira said.

“So is the wall,” Stoneveil replied.

Kael watched the exchange. Stoneveil’s face did not move. His eyes were on the map, the line of the city, the gates, the narrowing rings. He was not cruel. Kael knew that. Stoneveil was doing math. That was the cost of command.

Alira tied a bandage, then looked up. “If I send them now, they die on the wall.”

Stoneveil nodded once. “If you keep them, they die here, and the wall falls.”

Alira’s jaw tightened. She looked past Stoneveil to Kael, eyes hard. “Is this your judgment?”

Kael was not a commander. He could refuse. He could say that his faith did not permit it, that the wounded were sacred, that the Hall of the Fallen was not a reservoir of bodies. He could say it. He did not.

He felt the words in his throat and watched them crumble.

“Do it,” he said.

Alira’s eyes flicked away. She turned and shouted to her assistants. “You, you, you. We move.”

Kael did not look at Stoneveil. He did not look at the men being lifted from their cots. He did not look at the fear on their faces when they realized they were being marched back to the wall.

Stoneveil folded the map. “They’ll hold,” he said. It was not reassurance. It was statement.

Kael nodded. The movement felt like betrayal.

He moved back into the Hall. He found a cot with a woman whose eyes were fixed on the ceiling. Her mouth moved, soundless. He knelt, put ash on her brow.

“By Tyr’s judgment…”

He stopped. The words were right there. He could say them. He had said them all day. He could feel them now in his mouth, but they came slower. He saw the woman’s eyes. They were empty, not of life, but of hope. He saw her hands. They were covered in blood, not her own.

He said the rite. He forced each word out. He did not know if she heard him.

He moved to another cot. A boy, no older than fifteen, with a ragged tear across his abdomen. He was pale, lips blue. Kael touched his forehead and felt the cold.

“Do you want the rite?” Kael asked.

The boy’s eyes fluttered. He nodded once.

“By Tyr’s judgment, you are seen.”

The boy’s mouth moved, a question without sound.

Kael swallowed. “By Tyr’s hand, you are held.”

He stayed with the boy until the breath stopped. He had done that too many times. He stood. His knees cracked.

A bell rang somewhere in the Cathedral. It should have called to prayer. It was a warning. The sound was thin and lost in the noise of the Hall.

Kael moved toward the corridor again. The air there was cooler. He leaned his back against the stone for a moment and closed his eyes. He could hear the Hall behind him. He could hear the distant roar of the wall. He could hear his own breath.

He pressed his fingers to his forehead. The ash there was dry, flaking.

“By Tyr’s judgment,” he whispered.

He stopped.

The words did not fit. They were not false. They were not true. They were something between, and he did not know how to hold something between.

He opened his eyes and pushed away from the wall.

Night came without ceremony. The light in the Hall turned from gray to dim, oil-lamps filling the edges with thick yellow. The air was heavier. The wounded slowed only because there were no more hands to carry them.

Kael’s robe was stiff with dried blood now. His throat was raw. He had spoken thousands of words and none of them felt like they had done anything.

A soldier stumbled in, helmet in his hands. He was weeping quietly, breath shaking. He looked at Kael and shook his head.

“I killed a boy,” he said.

Kael did not ask why. He did not ask who. He knew. “Do you want the rite?”

The soldier nodded.

Kael raised his hand, ash in his palm, and began. “By Tyr’s judgment, you are—”

He stopped. The word refused him. He tried again.

“By Tyr’s judgment…”

Silence stretched between them. The soldier looked at him, eyes red.

Kael swallowed. He placed his hand on the man’s head without the words. The soldier closed his eyes.

Kael’s lips moved. He forced the prayer out, but the cadence was broken, the line stumbling.

“—you are seen,” he finished.

He stepped away. The soldier lowered himself to a bench, hands over his face.

Kael stood, feeling the weight of the Hall around him. The prayers did not change the blood. The rites did not change the gates. The faith he carried did not make the decisions smaller. It did not make the math kinder.

He turned toward the inner sanctum. He did not go in. He stopped in the corridor, alone for a moment.

He began the prayer again, for himself, a reflex, an anchor.

“By Tyr’s judgment, you are seen. By Tyr’s hand—”

The words broke in his mouth.

He closed his eyes.

“—you are…” he whispered.

It ended there.
