November found the line by following the noise. Not the big noise. That was everywhere now—horns, orders, the deep thud of engines beyond the walls. He followed the closer noise: boots on stone, metal dragged, voices hoarse from shouting. He kept his head down and moved where the flow moved.

The inner wall staging yard was a square of black stone and smoke. Men clustered in knots. A few women too. Not many. Most were in half-armor. Some had only a helmet or a shield. A few were in plain clothes with old blades. He fit with them.

A scribe sat at a table with a stack of slates. Two legionnaires stood behind him like a fence. The line for assignments kinked and slowed and surged. November stepped in it.

He touched the hilt at his belt as if that could make the thing real. It was a borrowed sword, thin and honest. The guard at the armory had measured him with tired eyes and handed it over without a word. The metal had been cold. He’d felt the weight all the way up his arm.

He didn’t speak. He didn’t need to. The line moved. He looked at the wall above the yard. He could see men on the parapet, heads and shoulders, moving in silhouette against gray morning. He could hear the scrape of stone as someone dragged a ladder into place. He could hear the bang of a gate dropped somewhere to the left.

He tried to keep track of where she might be. The Hall of the Fallen was behind him and to the right, across two inner streets. He had walked it in his head a dozen times since the blast. He knew the turns. He knew the door. He had gone there and found the entryway choked with wounded and blood and a man with a broken leg on a door dragged across the ground. He had asked for her. No one knew. No one had time.

So he came here.

The man ahead of him wore a smith’s apron over a patched gambeson. His hands were burned. The boy behind him had a sling and a black eye. The line moved.

When he got to the table, the scribe didn’t look up at first. He kept his chalk on the slate. “Name.”

“November Falls.”

The chalk paused. “Trade.”

“None.” He could have lied. “Laborer.”

The scribe’s eyes flicked up. They were ringed in red. “Can you hold a spear.”

“I can hold a sword.”

“You can hold a spear.”

November didn’t argue. The scribe wrote, then thrust the slate to the legionnaire behind him. The legionnaire took one look and jerked a thumb.

“Composite. Second shift. Inner wall.”

November stepped aside. A corporal in a battered breastplate pointed him toward a rack of weapons. The rack was mostly spears. He took one. It was longer than his height. The wood was rough. The point was pitted but sharp.

He went where the corporal pointed and found a cluster of men waiting under the wall. They were all strangers. A few looked at him. Most didn’t. They were tired already. That was the worst of it. The day had barely begun and they already looked like they’d been awake for three.

A boy sat on a barrel, helmet pushed back on his head. He was rubbing his palms together like he could warm them. He looked up at November and offered a hand without standing.

“Edric,” he said.

November took it. The grip was hard. He could feel the boy trying to make it firm.

“November.”

“Been up on the wall yet?”

“No.”

Edric nodded as if that answered other questions too. “They say the first wave’s goblins. Fast and dirty. Then the orcs come and you wish it had stayed goblins.”

“Do you believe everything you hear.”

“No.” Edric smiled and it made him look younger. “But I try to listen. Keeps me alive.”

November sat on the barrel beside him. He could hear the thud again, distant but steady. The siege engines. He couldn’t tell if he hated the sound or if the sound kept him anchored. It was proof of what was happening.

Edric glanced at November’s spear. “You ever used one.”

“A few times.”

“Me either.” He lifted his own. The point wobbled. He took a breath and steadied it. “My uncle says it’s all in the hips.”

“You listen to your uncle too.”

Edric shrugged. “He’s an inquisitor. Talks like the gods are listening.”

“Are they.”

“Depends on who you ask.” Edric stared up toward the wall. “You got family in the city?”

November shook his head.

“None.”

Edric didn’t push. He nodded, gaze still on the stones. The morning light caught the edge of his face. He was too young for the lines already starting at the corners of his eyes. Someone had put him in a helmet that didn’t quite fit. It sat too high and made his ears stick out.

“Why’d you volunteer.”

November looked down at his hands. Callused. The nails black from work that seemed like another life now. He could have said what he felt. He could have said, I’m looking for her. He could have said, I can’t stand still. He didn’t.

“Because I’m here,” he said.

Edric let out a slow breath. “Yeah. Me too.”

A horn blew. It was closer now. A ripple went through the yard. The corporal shouted for the composite unit. Men stood. November stood. Edric’s hands shook when he lifted his spear. He held it anyway.

They climbed.

The stairwell was cramped and smelled of sweat and wet stone. Men moved up in a line, their armor scraping. November felt the pressure of the men behind him. The wall itself felt like an animal, heavy and still, as if the stone knew it would have to hold.

At the top, the wind hit him. It was colder than he expected. It carried smoke and something sour beneath it. The parapet was wide enough for two men abreast if they shuffled. He walked behind the line of shields and looked out.

He saw the field.

It was bigger than he thought it would be. The plain outside Emberfall sloped down and away, broken by blackened stumps and the skeletons of old siege machines from wars he wasn’t old enough to remember. Across the field, a smear of movement. Orc tents. Goblin frames. A forest of stakes with skins and bones. He couldn’t pick out faces. He could pick out the engines.

They were already moving.

A stone rose up from the far line and arced. He watched it, helpless, as it sailed and fell. It hit somewhere to the right. The wall shook under his boots.

Men swore. Someone shouted to hold. The horn blew again, sharper. November gripped his spear. He found Edric’s helmet beside him and nodded once. Edric nodded back.

The first ladders came not at the gate but along the wall—thin lines of climbing wood carried by running figures. Goblins. Fast. Small. The archers cut into them. A few fell. Others kept coming. The ladders hit the stone with a sound like teeth against bone.

“Spears!” the corporal shouted. “Hold the lip!”

November stepped forward and set his foot against the base of the parapet, angled his spear point down. A goblin’s head appeared, then a hand. It was thin and gray-green, the nails like black hooks. He thrust. The spear point took the goblin in the shoulder. It squealed, high and sharp, and fell away.

Another hand. Another head. There were too many.

He felt his breath go quick. The air smelled like smoke and something burned that wasn’t wood.

He thrust again. The spear snagged on the ladder. He pulled and the ladder rocked. A goblin fell. Another one climbed over the body.

“Left!” Edric shouted.

November turned. A goblin had made it to the top. It was smaller than him by half, but it had a knife and it didn’t hesitate. It came in low. November tried to bring the spear around. The shaft clipped the goblin’s shoulder. The knife still came.

Pain bit his thigh. Not deep, but sharp. He stumbled back. The goblin rose with the blade in its hand. It was grinning. Its eyes were too big. Its teeth were too many.

November dropped the spear and went for his sword. He drew and swung too high. The goblin ducked under and slashed again. His leg burned. He kicked. His boot caught the goblin in the chest and drove it into the parapet. It hit, bounced, and went over the edge.

He stood there, breathing hard, sword in his hand, leg hot. He tried to draw breath and found he didn’t have enough of it.

“Hold the line!” the corporal yelled.

November picked up the spear. He dragged it free and reset. Another ladder hit. Another head appeared. He thrust and missed. The spear tip scraped stone.

He could feel the eyes of the man beside him. He didn’t look. He thrust again. He caught a goblin in the face. The goblin fell without a sound.

It didn’t feel like a victory. It felt like work.

A stone hit the wall again, this time closer. The parapet shook. Someone went down. November didn’t look. He held his spear and fought the climb.

Minutes became a blur of hands and heads. He stabbed, pulled, stabbed. His arms started to shake. His breath came in short pulls. He could hear Edric grunting beside him. The boy had blood on his cheek now, a smear that might have been his or someone else’s.

A goblin got a hook over the lip. It yanked. The hook snagged the edge and then a rope. Another goblin rose fast, nimble as a rat. November jammed the spear down. The point went into the goblin’s throat. The goblin gurgled, clutched at the shaft, and fell.

The rope held. Another goblin came up.

November’s arms were getting heavy. He looked down at his hands and saw he was shaking. He tightened his grip. The world narrowed to the edge of the wall, the ladder rungs, the sound of breath.

He heard a different sound then. Lower. The ground itself seemed to thrum. He looked past the ladders and saw a line of bodies moving in the field. Orcs. They were slower, heavier. They were coming with shields and hooks and a ram.

The goblins were a distraction. He knew it, but it didn’t change the fact that he still had to stop them.

“Hold!” the corporal shouted again. “Hold or we’re dead!”

A goblin made it to the top again. It was right in front of Edric. Edric thrust too late. The goblin slashed and Edric recoiled, a cry tearing out of him. November lunged. He put his spear through the goblin’s ribs. It fell. He grabbed Edric’s shoulder and pulled him back behind the shield line.

“Keep it tight,” November said. He didn’t realize he said it until it was out.

Edric nodded, teeth clenched. Blood was coming through his sleeve. Not pouring. Enough.

“You hit.”

Edric looked down. “Yeah.”

“Hold the line.”

Edric took a breath. He lifted his spear again.

Another impact. Stone dust rained down. November coughed. The air was dirty. The smoke carried in and blurred the field.

Somewhere to the right, a cheer rose and fell. He didn’t know why. It didn’t matter.

A hook caught his spear. He jerked back. The hook pulled again. His hands slipped. The spear went over the edge. He swore under his breath and reached for his sword. He didn’t have time to think. A goblin came up. He swung and felt the blade bite. The goblin fell. Another came. He blocked a slash. The blade rang. His arm jarred.

His leg flared where the knife had cut him. It wasn’t deep. It still hurt.

He moved too far forward. A goblin caught him with a club. It hit his ribs. He felt the air go out. He stumbled. The goblin grinned. It came again.

November swung, sloppy, and the goblin ducked under. The club came up. It hit his jaw. He saw white. He staggered and almost went over the edge. A hand grabbed his collar and hauled him back.

“Stay in!” Edric shouted.

November nodded, mouth full of blood. He spat and it came out red.

He could have stepped back. He could have dropped to his knees and stayed under the parapet. He didn’t. He put his foot back on the stone lip and raised his sword again.

He heard a voice in his head, steady and quiet. We do not abandon.

He didn’t say it. He didn’t need to. He set his jaw and watched the next goblin rise.

The orcs hit then, their hooks catching the wall, their ladder-like frames scraping. They moved slower but they were taller. A head came up. It was huge. Tusks. A shield. The shield came up and blocked his thrust. The orc shoved. The shield hit him in the chest. He stumbled. He caught the parapet with a hand and kept from falling.

The orc swung a hook at his head. November ducked. The hook caught the edge and stuck. November chopped at the orc’s arm. The blade bit. The orc snarled, a thick sound, and jerked back. Blood ran down its arm. It didn’t fall. It pulled itself up anyway.

November’s blade snagged. He pulled. The orc was coming over. He backed and set his feet. The orc landed on the parapet, shield up, axe in its other hand. It was taller than him by a head, wider by two shoulders. Its eyes were small and furious.

It said something. The words were guttural, broken. “Wall-men. Die.”

November swallowed and brought his blade up. He thought of his training. He thought of where to place his feet. He thought of nothing.

The orc swung. The axe came down. November blocked. The impact drove him back. He felt it in his arms. The orc drove again. He blocked again. He couldn’t match the strength.

He tried to cut at the orc’s leg. The orc stepped back and kicked. The kick hit his knee. He went down.

The world tilted. The stone scraped his back. He tried to get up. The orc loomed.

Edric’s spear jabbed at the orc’s side. It didn’t penetrate. The orc turned, snarled. That gave November a second. He pushed up, ignoring the fire in his knee, and drove his blade into the orc’s lower rib. He felt it hit bone. He pushed harder.

The orc roared. It swung its shield and caught him in the jaw. He saw stars and fell back.

The orc staggered. Edric jabbed again. The spear went in this time. The orc grabbed the shaft and snapped it with a jerk. It turned back to November, blood on its tusk.

November’s sword was still in its ribs. He grabbed the hilt, pulled, and the blade came free with a wet sound. He tried to rise. His knee buckled.

The orc lifted its axe.

Another blade took it in the neck from the side. The orc shuddered and fell forward, axe dropping. A legionnaire he didn’t know stood there, breath heaving, eyes wild.

“Move,” the legionnaire snarled.

November crawled backward, then got to his feet on his good leg. His knee hurt. His jaw hurt. His head rang. He was alive.

“Edric,” he said.

Edric had stepped back, breathing fast. His spear was broken. His sleeve was red to the elbow.

“You all right.”

Edric nodded. “Yeah.”

“Take my spear.”

He hadn’t realized he’d picked another. It was in his left hand. He pushed it toward Edric. Edric took it.

“You need it.”

“I can use a sword.”

Edric hesitated, then nodded and stepped back into line.

The fighting didn’t stop. It wasn’t a wave. It was a push. Ladders, hooks, ropes. Goblins, then orcs, then goblins again. The wall took them and the men took them and the line held.

November’s hands kept moving. He didn’t think about the cut on his leg or the swelling in his jaw. He set his feet and did the work. His sword was heavy. His arm was heavy. He didn’t stop.

Someone to his left went down with a spear in his throat. November reached and caught him by the shoulder, dragged him back. The man’s eyes were wide. He gurgled. November set him against the stone.

A healer wasn’t coming. The line was too tight. The man’s hands scrabbled at November’s sleeve. November put his hand over the wound, pressed, held. The man’s eyes locked on his. He was trying to breathe.

“I’ve got you,” November said. He didn’t know if it was true. He pressed harder. The man’s grip loosened. His eyes went blank. He was gone.

November kept his hand there for a beat too long. He could still feel the warmth draining. He took his hand away and it came up red.

“Back to the line!” the corporal shouted.

November wiped his palm on his pants and stepped back into place.

The orcs were still coming. The goblins were still coming. The air was thick with smoke and sweat and metal. His shoulder ached where the club had hit. His knee throbbed. His leg burned. He didn’t step away.

At some point the ladders thinned. The line eased. The horns changed. The orcs fell back, hauling their wounded. The goblins scattered. The field was littered with bodies and broken wood.

“Hold!” the corporal shouted, but his voice was hoarse now. “Hold. Don’t chase.”

No one chased. No one could have. Men leaned on their spears, breathing hard. A few sat down against the parapet. November did not. He stayed standing. His vision swam. He blinked and the wall came back into focus.

Edric was beside him, cheeks streaked with grime, eyes bright. “We did it,” he said, voice low.

“It’s not done.”

Edric nodded. “No.”

A runner came down the wall with orders. “Rotate!” he shouted. “Second shift down. First shift up.”

The line moved. November stepped back, legs stiff. He realized his leg was wet. He looked down. The cut had bled through his pants. It wasn’t bad. It stung. He could walk.

Edric walked with him. His sleeve was darker now. He tried not to look at it. November did anyway.

“We should get that looked at.”

Edric shrugged. “Later.”

“There might not be later.”

Edric looked at him. “There was just now. We’re still here.”

November couldn’t argue. He let the thought sit.

They went down the stairwell in a slow stream. The yard below was chaos. Wounded on stretchers. Men with empty eyes. A few with bright eyes. A pile of broken spears.

A woman in an apron shouted for clean cloth. A boy ran past carrying a bucket. The armory line was gone. The scribe was gone. The table was gone. Only the stone remained.

Edric paused, looking toward the Hall of the Fallen. “You going.”

“I need to check.”

Edric nodded. “If you find anyone with an extra bandage, I’ll take it.”

November almost smiled. “Save some blood for me.”

Edric’s grin flashed and then was gone. He lifted his spear and turned toward the re-forming line for the next shift. He was still there. That mattered.

November moved toward the Hall of the Fallen. The path was cluttered. He pushed through men, through carts, through a woman carrying a basket of arrows. He kept his head down. He didn’t ask for her again. He didn’t have the breath.

The Hall was worse than before. The entryway was jammed. A man sat on a stool with his leg bandaged to a stump. A healer knelt by a child. Someone was screaming in the back. The smell of blood was thick enough to taste.

November scanned faces. None were hers.

He found a basin and washed his hands. The water turned red. He splashed his face. His jaw hurt. His cheek felt swollen. His eye was swelling too. He pressed his fingers against it. It was sore, but it opened. He could see.

A healer with gray hair came over. She looked at his leg. “Sit.”

“I’m fine.”

“Sit.”

He sat. She cut the cloth around his thigh and looked at the cut. She clicked her tongue. “You let this go too long.”

“It didn’t feel long.”

She cleaned it. It burned. He didn’t flinch. She wrapped it tight. “Keep it dry. If it opens again, you’ll limp.”

“I’m already limping.”

She looked at him. Her eyes were tired. “You shouldn’t be there.”

“No one should.”

She didn’t respond. She moved on to the next man.

November stood and shifted his weight. The leg held. He could walk.

He stepped outside. The sky was gray. Smoke made it darker. The horns were quieter now but not gone. The city hummed with the kind of silence that comes after a scream. It wasn’t peace. It was just the space between blows.

He went back toward the wall. He didn’t think about it. He just went.

By the time he reached the staging yard again, the next shift was already climbing. He could have stopped. He could have sat. He didn’t.

He found Edric leaning against a crate, eyes half-closed. He was still on his feet. His sleeve was wrapped in a fresh bandage. He opened his eyes as November approached. “You find her.”

November shook his head.

Edric nodded once. He didn’t say sorry. That was good. “We go back up soon.”

November looked at the wall. He could still hear the distant thud. He nodded. “Yeah.”

They stood there in the gray, breathing in the smoke. Men moved around them. Orders came and went. No one had time to look at them, to tell them they were doing something wrong.

November felt his teeth. There was blood there. He spat. It was rust and iron on his tongue. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.

He was tired. He was hurt. He was still here.

He lifted his spear and waited for the call.
