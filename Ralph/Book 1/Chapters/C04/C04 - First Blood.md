November woke to iron and smoke.

Not the good kind. Not the forge’s clean, hot bite. This was damp metal, cold sweat, the sour edge of fear. He rolled off the cot and planted his feet on the stone. The world swayed. He let it. The stone didn’t move.

Outside, horns were already calling shifts. Short blasts. Fewer words than usual. The siege had already changed how people spoke.

He pulled on his boots and stepped into the inner wall staging area.

The corridor was a throat of soot-stained stone. Men and women moved through it with the same hollow speed. Not panic. Not calm. Motion without choice. A line of spears leaned against the wall, tips dulled from the first day’s drills. The armory line spilled around a corner, a quiet snake of bodies.

November joined the end of it. He hadn’t slept much, but his head was still. The stillness was the only thing he trusted right now.

He wasn’t supposed to be here. He told himself that on every step. He was a civilian. A man who trained on bad days and patched wounds on worse ones. No papers, no oath. The wall was for soldiers.

Then he saw the names on the casualty board.

It was a slate nailed to the corridor wall. Chalked columns. Day 1. Names already smudged.

A healer’s name was not on it. That didn’t mean anything. The Hall of the Fallen kept its own list. No one knew where those lists were now.

He kept his eyes off the board and let his hands do the work. He tightened his belt, adjusted the strap on the borrowed sword at his hip. He was not here to grieve. He was here to find. The best way to find was to be where the fighting was.

A quartermaster in a dark leather jerkin stood behind a table. He slapped a short spear into a man’s hands, then a shield. He did it again. The rhythm had teeth.

“Name?” the quartermaster said when November stepped up.

“November Falls.”

The man paused. “Volunteering?”

“Yes.”

The quartermaster looked him over. No armor. Old bruises yellowing on his forearms. The hands of someone who worked. The eyes of someone who hadn’t slept much.

He slid a shield across the table. Worn iron boss, wood split and repaired at least twice. “You got training?”

“Some.”

“Right.” He looked past November. “Next.”

November took the shield anyway.

He moved toward the armory line. A smith was fitting men with mismatched helmets. A woman in a mail coif used a hammer to knock a dent out of a breastplate while the next in line held it still.

A man ahead of him glanced back. Young. Dark hair. Wide eyes. He was trying to act like the noise didn’t get to him.

“You volunteer too?” the man asked.

November nodded.

“Name?”

“November.”

“Edric,” the man said. He offered a hand. It shook a little.

November took it. “You with the Legion?”

“Assigned.” Edric’s grip tightened. He noticed his own hand and let go fast. “I— I’m gate garrison. Or was. They said composite unit now.”

“Composite?”

“Everyone left who can hold a shield. That’s what the sergeant said.” He tried to smile. It didn’t land. “You fight?”

“Not in a line.”

“Right.” Edric swallowed. “At least there’s a wall.”

November didn’t answer. He watched the boy’s eyes flick toward the corridor mouth where the light changed. He looked like he was waiting for a name to be called, for someone to tell him this was a mistake and send him home.

No one did.

They moved forward together. A helmet was pushed into November’s hands. Too big. He set it on his head anyway. It sat low, pressing his ears.

A sergeant took a strip of parchment and barked names. “Composite Third. You’re with me. Name?”

“Edric Thane.”

The sergeant’s eyes sharpened. “Thane?”

“Yes, ser.”

“You related to Kael Veyne?”

Edric blinked. “He’s my uncle.”

The sergeant gave him a hard look. “Lucky you. Unlucky for him.”

Edric swallowed. “Yes, ser.”

The sergeant turned to November. “Name?”

“November Falls.”

“No relation to anybody I know.” The sergeant held a finger against the parchment. “You two. That wall section. We need bodies at the breach patch. Follow.”

They did.

The wall position was a walkway of stone and iron, a dark spine of Emberfall. The air smelled like oil and damp soot. Beyond the parapet, the morning was gray, but the horizon was already bruised with smoke.

November stood in a line of defenders, shoulder to shoulder with strangers. Above the merlons, the land beyond the walls was littered with movement. Orcs. Goblins. Shapes like ink. The siege engines crouched among them like broken teeth.

He tried to find the Hall of the Fallen from up here. He couldn’t. Too much smoke. Too much distance.

Edric moved to his left. A woman with a pitted helmet stood to his right. She leaned over and spat off the wall.

“Never seen you,” she said.

“I’m not usually here.”

“That’s fine.” She patted the wall. “We all are now.”

A horn blew. A deeper blast. The sound went through the wall and into their bones.

The sergeant shouted orders. “Shields up. Line tight. Don’t chase. Don’t be a hero. You’re here to stop them, not impress anyone.”

No one laughed.

Another horn. Closer. The clatter below the wall rose into a roar. The first ladders hit stone.

November tightened his grip on the shield. It felt wrong, the weight and angle. He had trained with sticks and practice blades, not a slab of iron and wood on his arm. The shield pulled him off balance. He adjusted his stance, feet wider, knees bent.

He watched the ladder to his right. Orcs climbed fast. Thick arms. Dirty tusks. Their hands were bare against the wood and they didn’t flinch. One reached the top.

The woman beside November stabbed down. Her spear went into the orc’s throat. He fell without a sound. A second orc climbed over the first and kept coming.

Edric raised his spear. He was shaking. He did it anyway.

The orc cleared the wall and landed hard. It turned its head and found November.

Up close, it was bigger. Not in the stories way. In the real way. Broad shoulders. A scar that cut across one eye. The eye that worked held a flat, animal focus.

November’s shield lifted too late. The orc’s axe caught the edge and jolted his arm. The impact rattled his teeth. He felt the line of pain from wrist to shoulder. The orc shoved forward.

November stepped back and let the shield slide, using the move to bring his sword up. He slashed across the orc’s forearm. The blade bit shallow. The orc grunted and hit him with the haft.

It caught him in the ribs. He went down hard.

The stone knocked the breath out of him. For a second there was only light and pain. He heard someone shout his name. Or maybe it was just shouting.

He rolled, trying to get his shield between him and the orc. The orc was already on him. He saw the axe rise. It was too fast.

Edric hit the orc from the side. The spear went into its flank and skidded. The orc snarled, turned, and chopped at Edric. Edric stumbled back. The axe clipped his arm. Blood spattered the wall.

November pushed himself up.

His ribs screamed. He ignored them. He shoved his shield into the orc’s chest and shoved again. The orc staggered. November drove his sword into the orc’s thigh. It wasn’t clean. It was ugly and wrong. The orc howled and swung.

The axe hit the shield again, splitting the old wood. The boss held. November saw the opening. He drove his shoulder into the orc and the two of them went into the wall. The orc’s breath was hot and rancid. It groped for him with a hand the size of his head.

A spear thrust from the woman beside him struck the orc in the side of the neck. The orc made a wet sound and fell.

November stumbled back, chest heaving. He tasted blood. He wasn’t sure if it was his.

Edric leaned against the wall, clutching his arm. His face was white. “I— I’m fine.”

“You’re bleeding.”

“Not bad.” Edric looked down at his arm and swayed.

November grabbed him by the shoulder and shoved him toward the walkway’s inner edge. “Sit. Now.”

Edric sat. The wall was slick with blood and smoke. November peeled back Edric’s sleeve. The wound was a gash, not deep but long. He tore a strip from his own shirt and wrapped it tight.

“You were in front of him,” Edric said. “He was going to—”

“Stop talking.”

Edric shut up. He watched the blood seep into the cloth.

A goblin voice yapped up from the ladder. “Up, up! ‘Eavy boy! Move it!”

A goblin climbed, smaller, faster. It had a hooked blade and a grin too wide for its face. It popped over the edge and saw November.

“Human,” it hissed. “Wall’s ours.”

It darted in. The blade was quick, cutting at November’s leg. He tried to block. The shield was cracked and slow.

The blade bit his thigh. Fire ran down to his knee.

He swung at the goblin and missed. The goblin laughed. It danced back and came again, the knife flicking toward his hip.

November moved forward instead of back. He used his shield like a battering ram and slammed the goblin in the chest. The goblin hit the parapet and gasped. November’s sword caught it in the shoulder. The blade stuck.

He yanked. The goblin grabbed the sword with both hands, screeching. Its eyes were wild, its teeth too sharp.

“Let go,” November said.

The goblin spat blood and laughed.

He drove his knee into the goblin’s stomach. The goblin folded. He pulled the sword free and shoved the goblin over the parapet.

It fell screaming.

The wall around him roared as more ladders hit, more bodies climbed. The sergeant yelled for a line shift. November moved with it. He dragged his shield behind him. The splinters bit his forearm.

More orcs came. A ladder to his left. A ladder to his right. The wall was alive with movement. It was a knot of bodies, a crush of steel and breath and noise.

He fought badly. He swung too wide. He stabbed too late. He relied on the shield until it failed, then he had to learn to move without it. He took a hit to the shoulder that numbed his arm. He took another to the thigh that sent him limping.

He stayed.

There was a moment when the line broke. The orcs surged onto the wall and for a breath it felt like the wall would empty. Men stepped back. Someone shouted to fall back. A hand grabbed his sleeve.

“Move!” a soldier yelled.

November looked at the gap where the orcs were climbing. He saw a young woman stumble there, her spear knocked out of her hands. An orc was on her, axe raised.

He moved toward her.

It was stupid. It was all he could do.

He collided with the orc and they both went down. His shoulder took the impact. The pain was bright. He shoved his sword into the orc’s side. It hit bone. He pushed harder. The orc slammed its head into his and for a second the world went white.

He felt the orc go slack. He rolled off it. The woman stared at him with wide eyes, then grabbed her spear and got up.

“Thanks,” she said. It was automatic. She was already moving.

He got up too.

The sergeant was shouting again. “Line up! Tight! Tight!”

Edric was back on his feet, one arm bound and hanging useless. He held his spear in the other. It wobbled but he kept it upright. He saw November and his face eased.

November nodded. That was all. The nod meant: still here.

They fought for hours. Time was broken into hits and breaths and small choices. The wall became a strip of stone that existed only in front of him. The rest of the world fell away.

He did not win any fight. He survived them.

He took another hit, this one from a goblin’s sling stone that cracked off his cheek. Blood ran into his mouth. He spit it out. The taste was bitter and copper.

He kept moving.

Somewhere in the middle of it, the Creed came into his head. Not as words, not as a phrase. As a weight on his chest. As the pressure to stay even when the body told him no. It didn’t make him stronger. It made him steadier.

He saw a legionnaire try to pull a wounded man out of the line and fail. The wounded man’s leg was gone below the knee. Blood poured onto the stone. The legionnaire was struggling with the weight.

November moved. He grabbed the wounded man under the arms. The man’s head lolled. His eyes were open but empty. November hauled him back behind the line. His thigh burned. His ribs burned. He did it anyway.

He set the man down behind the parapet. A healer darted in and pressed cloth to the stump. “Thank you,” she said without looking up.

He turned back to the wall.

The assault finally ebbed. The orcs pulled back first, dragging their dead. Goblins disappeared in the smoke. The ladders were shoved away. The wall stayed standing.

The horn blew again, different this time. The sound was thin. A lull. Not a victory.

November leaned against the parapet and closed his eyes. His breathing came in short, sharp pulls.

Edric sat beside him. “You okay?”

“No.”

Edric huffed a small laugh. “Me neither.”

They sat in the dark light of a smoke-choked morning. The stones under them were warm from bodies and sun. The wall smelled like blood and iron and wet ash.

The sergeant moved down the line, counting. He looked at November, then at Edric. “You two still breathing?”

“Yes, ser.”

“Good.” He slapped November’s shoulder, then stopped as if he realized he’d hit a bruise. “We’ll need you again.”

“Understood.”

The sergeant moved on.

Edric stared at his bandaged arm. “I killed one.”

“Did you?”

“Yeah.” His voice had a shake. “I don’t know if that’s a good thing.”

November looked out over the wall. The field was dotted with bodies. Some moved. Some didn’t.

“I don’t know either.”

Edric glanced at him. “Why are you here?”

November could have lied. He could have said the creed or duty or the city. All of that was true, and none of it was the whole truth.

“She’s missing,” he said. “The healer. She was in the Hall. The blast hit. I need to find her.”

Edric nodded. He didn’t ask for a name. He didn’t need it. “We’ll keep an eye out.”

November felt the weight of the promise. He didn’t correct it. He couldn’t.

The line was quiet now. Men and women slumped against the wall, hands shaking as they drank from canteens. Some sat with their heads between their knees. One stared at his hands as if they weren’t his.

November looked down at his own hands. They were red. Not all of it was his. He wiped them on his trousers.

His thigh throbbed. His shoulder was a dead limb. His mouth tasted like iron and smoke. His teeth hurt.

He was still standing.

He turned his face toward the inner wall. The city was hidden by smoke and the low rooftops. Somewhere below, the Hall of the Fallen was a quiet box of stone in a city that wouldn’t stop burning.

He would go there when the line allowed. He would search until his legs failed. He would look in every cot and every row of the wounded.

For now, he was on the wall.

For now, he stayed.

The horn called again. The lull was over.
