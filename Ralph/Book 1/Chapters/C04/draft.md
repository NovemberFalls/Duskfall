Gray light leaked over the inner wall like thin ash. It didn’t warm anything. It just made the soot on the stones visible again.

November stood in the staging yard with a line of other men. He wasn’t in uniform. He was a civilian in a coat that had been gray once, with a borrowed sword at his hip and a scrap of leather tied over his left forearm. He had slept, if you could call it that. A wall. A floor. Ten minutes at a time. He had woken to horns, then to a shout, then to the memory of a woman’s name turning in his mouth.

He didn’t say it out loud. The air was full of other names already.

The yard was packed. Soldiers, smiths, laborers, boys whose faces still held the softness of night. They lined up between the armory crates and the water barrels and waited for someone to decide where they would go. The inner wall cast a shadow over all of them.

November rolled his shoulders. The bruises from Day One were there when he moved. A dull ache in his ribs. A sharp, small pain in his wrist where he’d caught the ground hard. He could still close his hand. That mattered.

A woman in a stained tunic moved between them with a bucket and a ladle. She wasn’t a healer. She wasn’t dressed like the Hall. She didn’t have Horus’s hands. She just poured water into tin cups and said, “Drink.”

He drank.

Across the yard, a captain stood on a crate with a slate board in one hand. He was reading names. There were too many. He looked tired. He had the look of a man who had slept in armor and then had to wake up and pretend that made him stronger.

“Gate volunteers,” the captain said. “You take this line.”

November stepped out with the others. He didn’t look back.

A man beside him hesitated. Older, gray hair, hands that had held tools more than weapons. November didn’t tell him what to do. The man swallowed and moved forward. The line closed.

They were marched toward the armory line. It was a thin line, and it didn’t move fast. They could hear the clang of iron inside and the sound of men swearing as straps snapped or buckles bent.

The armory sergeant was a block of a man with a beard like wire. He didn’t look up as he handed out gear.

“Name.”

“November Falls.”

The sergeant flicked his eyes up. There was no recognition. Just assessment. He looked down again and shoved a helmet into November’s chest.

“Take it or don’t. It won’t fit anyway.”

It didn’t. The helmet wobbled and sat too high. The strap had lost its buckle. November tied it on with a strip of cloth and accepted the wobble.

“Next.”

A boy stepped up. Nineteen, maybe. Thin. Black hair. Eyes a little too wide. He had a soldier’s tunic on, but it hung on him like a borrowed coat. He said his name and the sergeant pushed a short spear across.

“Edric Thane,” the boy said.

The sergeant didn’t react. November did. The name meant nothing to him. The way the boy said it did. He said it like it mattered. Like it was supposed to open doors. It didn’t. He took the spear with both hands.

They moved to the side and waited. The line of volunteers thickened into a cluster. The captain waved them over to another man in a patched breastplate.

“This is your unit. Composite. You’re with him.”

The man was older than the captain, a veteran by the look of his face. He had a broad nose that had been broken at least twice and a scar that dragged one eyebrow down. He watched them, quick and cold.

“Name’s Garren,” he said. “If you can’t lift your weapon, drop it. If you can’t fight, don’t pretend. Stay behind the shield and do what you’re told.”

No speech. No welcome. Just a list of conditions.

He walked them toward the wall.

The inner wall was a long spine of black stone. It had been built to stop a flood. It had never been meant for this. There were scorch marks on it already. Above them, a few archers watched the horizon, their faces smudged with soot. A smell of oil and smoke hung in the air. It got into November’s throat.

Edric walked beside him. The boy kept his spear tip up like he’d been told. He glanced at November, then looked away.

“You ever been on the wall?” Edric asked.

“No,” November said.

“Me neither.”

They walked in silence for a moment.

“I’m not supposed to be on the gate,” Edric said. He said it like it was a confession.

November didn’t answer. It wasn’t his business, and he didn’t know what to do with it.

The wall position was a section between two squat towers. A parapet, a walkway, and a set of steps that ran down into the yard behind. There were stacks of rocks and bundles of broken weapons to throw. There were men already there, scarred and quiet.

Garren pointed with his chin. “You’re on that line. Keep your head down. When they come up, you push. If you fall, don’t fall forward.”

“Why?” Edric asked.

“You fall forward, you go over,” Garren said. “Then you die on the wrong side.”

That was the only reason.

They took their places. November stood on the inside of the parapet, sword in his right hand, leather scrap on his left forearm. He could feel the wall under his boots. It was cold. The stone drank the morning.

He looked out.

The field beyond the inner wall sloped down to the outer ring. Smoke rose from there. Somewhere beyond the smoke were the orc lines. He couldn’t see them. He could hear them. A low rumble, like a storm at the edge of hearing. A horn sounded in the distance. One note, then another.

Edric swallowed. He looked at his spear tip as if it were a question he didn’t know how to answer. November tightened his grip on the sword. The leather strap dug into his palm. He let it.

He checked his inner compass without thinking. Am I here? Yes. Am I doing what needs doing? Yes. That was enough.

The first impact came like a cough. A stone hit the wall to the left and exploded into chips. Men flinched. Another stone hit farther down. A third. The sound of it was not like thunder. It was more like a hammer in a forge, but muffled by distance and the thick wall.

Archers leaned out and began firing. Their arrows vanished into smoke. A few clattered back, spent. The horn sounded again, closer now.

“Up,” Garren said. “Shields.”

There were no shields for the volunteers. The regulars lifted iron. The rest lifted whatever they had. November raised his leather-wrapped arm and felt stupid doing it. He did it anyway.

The first ladders appeared like black teeth against the wall. Men shouted. Rocks went down. Oil was poured. A scream rose, cut short.

Then hands grabbed the parapet.

An orc’s face came up, teeth bared, eyes yellow. It was closer than November expected. It smelled. The orc heaved, and its head crested. A spear jabbed into its chest from the side, and it fell backward without a sound. Edric’s spear. The boy’s face went pale. His mouth opened and closed like he was trying to breathe through water.

Another orc came up, then another. The wall went from empty to full in a breath.

“Push!” Garren shouted.

November stepped forward. The first orc he faced had a hook in its hand and a scar running from jaw to ear. It swung. November lifted his arm too late. The hook caught leather and bit through. Pain burned up his forearm. He swung his sword and hit bone, not blade. The sword jolted. The orc’s weapon tore free, taking leather and skin. November’s forearm went hot.

He swung again. Clumsy. The orc leaned in and grabbed his collar. Its breath was rotten. It pulled. November stumbled. His sword arm flailed.

Someone hit the orc from behind. The creature jerked, turned, and went down. November saw Edric’s spear shaft flex, heard the crack of ribs. Edric pulled the spear back and looked at the blood on it like it was a stain he didn’t know how to clean.

“Focus!” Garren’s voice cut through. “They’re up!”

More orcs climbed. The line surged. The wall became a pushing match with teeth.

November moved because everyone else moved. He shoved. He stabbed. He missed. He hit stone. His sword skidded along the parapet and jolted his wrist. He didn’t drop it. His left arm bled under the leather. It wasn’t a deep cut, but it kept opening when he moved.

A goblin crested the wall between two orcs. Smaller, quicker. It ducked under a swing and went for November’s legs. November tried to step back and found nothing. The wall behind him was there. He was already on it.

The goblin’s blade scraped his shin. He felt it more than he saw it. He lifted his foot and kicked. The goblin stumbled and a regular soldier’s spear came down through its shoulder. It shrieked and dropped.

November’s stomach churned. He forced it down.

He remembered the Creed. Not the words. Just the weight of it. We do not abandon. He looked to his right. A man there had gone down, his helmet cracked, blood in his eyes. He was trying to get up and couldn’t. An orc had seen him. It was coming over.

November moved. He stepped into the gap and swung at the orc. He hit it in the arm, not the head. The blade bit. The orc grunted and swung back. The blow clipped November’s shoulder and almost spun him. Pain flared. He kept his feet.

The orc came again. November lifted his forearm to block. The hook caught the raw cut and dug in. He felt his hand go numb. He screamed without sound and drove his sword forward, two-handed. It went into the orc’s belly and stuck. The orc fell backward and pulled the sword with it. November went forward, hands empty, and hit the parapet. He caught himself with his bleeding arm and tasted metal in his mouth.

He reached for the sword. It was gone.

“Down!” Garren shouted.

A rock sailed over the wall and smashed the stones behind them. Chips stung November’s cheek. Dust filled his mouth. He spat. Blood came with it. He didn’t know if it was his or the orc’s.

He grabbed a fallen spear. It was heavy and the balance was wrong. He didn’t have time to think about that. Another orc was coming up.

He thrust the spear. It scraped across armor. The orc snarled and struck back. The axe caught the spear shaft and knocked it aside. The orc surged onto the parapet. Its weight made the wall feel narrower.

November tried to pull the spear back. It snagged on a broken stone. He yanked and the shaft cracked. The orc lifted its axe.

A hammer came down on the orc’s head from the side. It crumpled. A woman in a steel cap spat and moved on.

November stood with half a spear in his hands.

“Keep moving,” Garren said. His voice was dry. He had blood on his cheek and didn’t seem to notice.

The assault went on. The wall held. Or it didn’t, and then it did again. The line shifted. Bodies dropped. Men stepped over them.

Time stopped being time. It was just the next hand on the stone, the next breath, the next strike.

November took another hit. A blunt blow to his ribs. Something in him popped or bruised or both. He coughed and the breath came ragged. He kept moving because there was nowhere else to go.

He saw Edric again, a few steps down. The boy was fighting like someone in a dream. His spear shook. His feet kept sliding. He looked terrified. He didn’t run.

A goblin grabbed Edric’s spear and yanked. The boy stumbled forward. An orc reached for his collar. November stepped in and shoved the spear butt into the orc’s face. The orc’s nose broke. It fell back and took the goblin with it. Edric regained his footing. He didn’t say thank you. He just fought.

The wall stank. Sweat and smoke and the sharp copper of blood. The sun climbed a little, but the smoke turned it into a pale coin.

At some point, the horn changed. A different note. A signal. The ladders stopped coming. The pressure eased. Men slumped against the parapet. Some slid down and didn’t get back up. The archers stopped firing. The field below was littered with bodies.

“Back,” Garren said. “Water. Check wounds. Don’t sit unless you’re staying.”

November backed away from the parapet and leaned against the wall. His left arm was slick with blood. The cut had opened wider. He should have wrapped it. He didn’t. He looked down and flexed his fingers. They moved. That was enough for now.

Edric came over and dropped onto the stone beside him. He was pale. There was blood on his hands that wasn’t his. He looked at it, then at November.

“Are you hurt?” he asked.

“Yeah.”

“Where?”

“Arm.”

Edric nodded, as if that was a list of tasks. He pulled a strip of cloth from his own sleeve and held it out.

November took it. His hands shook when he tied it. He didn’t think about how that looked. He tied it anyway.

“First time?” Edric asked.

“First time on the wall,” November said.

Edric let out a breath that sounded like a laugh that didn’t want to be.

“Did you think you’d be good?”

November looked at him. The boy was waiting. Not for reassurance. Just for truth.

“No,” November said.

Edric nodded as if that helped.

They sat in silence for a moment. Then a cry went up below. A man had fallen from the parapet and landed in the yard. He was alive, but his leg was wrong. A few of them moved toward him.

November pushed himself up and went. He didn’t think about it. The man was breathing and reaching for his own leg like he could put it back.

“Hold him,” someone said.

November knelt and took the man’s shoulders. The man thrashed. November held him down.

The healer who wasn’t from the Hall came and set the leg with a crack that made November’s stomach twist. The man screamed. November held him through it. Then he let go. His hands were wet.

He went back to the wall and picked up the half-spear again. It felt like a tool, not a weapon. He didn’t have his sword. He didn’t look for it. There were too many bodies on the parapet. He knew he wouldn’t find it. Not now.

Another horn sounded. The attack wasn’t done. It was just a breath.

Garren’s voice cut through the yard. “Back to the line.”

They went.

The second push was worse. The ladders came in a rush. The goblins were faster this time, getting under the throwing arcs. The orcs came over two at a time. The line wavered. A soldier to November’s left took an axe to the neck. Blood sprayed and hit November’s cheek. He didn’t wipe it. There was no time.

He used the broken spear like a club, smashing hands and faces. He did not win. He did not beat anyone clean. He bought seconds.

An orc got over with a shield. It shoved into the line and pushed men back. November jabbed at its shield and the spear snapped further. He let it fall and grabbed the orc’s shield rim with his good hand. His arm screamed. He shoved and the shield moved an inch. The orc hit him in the face with its elbow. Stars went off behind his eyes. He stumbled. The parapet edge bit into his hip.

Edric screamed. November heard the fear in it. He looked. Edric was tangled with a goblin, the spear between them. The goblin had a knife and was working it toward Edric’s side. Edric’s hands shook and his face went white.

November moved. He shoved the goblin’s shoulder. The goblin twisted and slashed. The blade caught November’s forearm, the same cut. He hissed and used his other hand to drive the goblin’s head into the parapet. It went limp. He let it drop.

Edric was breathing hard. He looked at November and then away. He didn’t say anything. He just lifted his spear again.

The line held. It was ugly. It was inches. It was men bracing their boots against slick stone and pushing until their legs shook. It was hands pulling others back from the edge. It was a man saying “Hold” because he had nothing else left to say.

November took another hit. A rock caught his shoulder and drove him to his knees. Pain shot up his neck. He tasted blood and realized he’d bitten his tongue. He spat. The ground was red.

“Get up,” someone said.

He didn’t know who. He didn’t look. He got up.

His left arm was nearly numb now. The cloth was soaked and slippery. He tried to tighten it and couldn’t. He gave up. He kept his right hand on the parapet and waited for the next ladder.

He thought of Horus again, not as a memory but as a fact. She was out there somewhere. Or she was not. He didn’t know. He was here because he didn’t know. He was here because if he left, he would be the man he had been before, and he had killed that man.

We do not abandon.

The thought was a stone in his chest. He carried it. It did not make him stronger. It just made leaving impossible.

The final push broke in the early midmorning light. A horn. A retreat. The ladders dropped away. The field below the wall was thick with bodies and smoke. The sound of the orc drums faded. The wall went quiet except for the breathing.

November leaned on the parapet and realized his hands were shaking. He forced them to still. He looked down at the yard. Men were carrying bodies toward the center. Not just the dead. The wounded, too. The line of stretchers went toward the Hall of the Fallen.

He didn’t see Horus. That meant nothing. It meant everything.

Garren walked down the line, counting heads. He stopped at November. He looked at the blood on November’s sleeve and the rawness of the cut. He looked at November’s face.

“You should be in the yard,” Garren said.

“I can stand,” November said.

“You can bleed,” Garren said. “Do both in the yard.”

November didn’t move. He wanted to. He wanted to lie down and let someone else take the wall. He didn’t.

Garren stared at him for a moment. Then he nodded once and moved on.

Edric sank to the stone beside November. He was pale. He had a cut above his brow that bled down his cheek.

“You okay?” November asked.

Edric nodded. It wasn’t convincing.

“You did good,” November said.

Edric looked at him as if he didn’t understand the sentence.

“I didn’t—” He stopped. He swallowed. “I almost—”

“You didn’t,” November said.

Edric looked down at his spear. His hands were still shaking.

“First time,” he said.

“Yeah,” November said.

They sat in silence. The wall beneath them was warm now, not from the sun but from the bodies that had pressed against it. November took slow breaths. His ribs hurt. His arm throbbed. His mouth tasted like metal.

He could hear the yard behind them. Orders. Crying. A hammer on iron. A prayer spoken too quietly to be heard.

He had blood on his teeth. He knew it because he could feel the grit when he closed his mouth. He didn’t wipe it away. He wasn’t sure when he’d started bleeding there. It didn’t matter.

He was still standing.

Not because he was good. Not because he won.

Because he stayed.
