# C01 - The Last Good Morning (v5_4) — Edit History & Rationale

This README captures the major edits and decisions that shaped **C01 v5_4** from earlier drafts. It is specific to **Chapter 1** and documents *what changed and why*.

## High-Level Arc (Locked in v5_4)
The final arc is a clean grimdark escalation:

Quiet morning -> discipline/temptation -> walk to Hall -> return home -> horn -> impacts -> Hall collapse -> Horus missing.

This structure was chosen to preserve a **tight scene economy** and a clear tragic engine.

## Major Revisions (What We Changed and Why)

### 1) Tone Shift to Grimdark (without melodrama)
**Change:** Sharpened diction, tightened rhythm, more tactile sensory grounding, and reduced “authorly” commentary.
**Why:** Needed to align with grimdark expectations: harsh world, dread under the surface, bitter-sweet warmth without softening stakes.

### 2) Inner Enemy / Temptation Beat Reintroduced
**Change:** Added the **alley / glass clink / body leans** moment, then the conscious refusal.
**Why:** V2’s strongest grimdark engine was the internal struggle; v5_4 restores it so November feels disciplined, not saintly.

### 3) Good-Deeds Montage Compressed
**Change:** Multiple “helping” vignettes were cut down to a **single short beat** (water pump + neighbor).
**Why:** Too many good deeds made him read like a saint. Grimdark needs virtue with pressure and restraint, not a parade of kindness.

### 4) Horus/November Intimacy Tuned
**Change:** Kept **specific domestic moments** (breakfast, collar, kiss), removed excess.
**Why:** Intimacy creates contrast and increases loss impact, but too many beats slow pacing. v5_4 keeps only the strongest, most “earned” moments.

### 5) Escalation Clarified
**Change:** Impact sequence clarified with spacing, sensory sequencing, and concrete images.
**Why:** Ensures the reader can follow the catastrophe step-by-step without losing momentum or geography.

### 6) Moral Gray Moment Added
**Change:** November **tears free** from a wounded person near the Hall, then feels shame.
**Why:** Grimdark requires hard choices. This grounds him as good *but not clean*.

### 7) Horus-Specific Trace in the Rubble
**Change:** Added a **double-knot linen** with her soap scent.
**Why:** This provides a dread-hook without confirmation, keeping tension and loss intact.

### 8) “He… He… He…” Rhythm Reduced
**Change:** Varied sentence openings and combined actions to avoid visible draft cadence.
**Why:** The repeated “He…” rhythm read as drafting rather than authored prose. v5_4 keeps it only where it adds intensity.

### 9) Continuity Fixes
**Change:** All physical marks and references are explicitly established (e.g., **knuckle scrape from the bucket handle**).
**Why:** Earlier versions referenced details that were never introduced. v5_4 ensures every reference is earned in-text.

### 10) Timeline Anchors Inserted
**Change:** Added a concrete time cue (“By midmorning...”) to align half-shift vs waiting.
**Why:** Removed logic snags that made the passage of time feel inconsistent.

## Final v5_4 Qualities (Intentional Targets)
- **Grimdark but not nihilistic**: light in the darkness, but no false comfort.
- **Disciplined protagonist**: choice under pressure, not a spotless hero.
- **Emotional rebar**: intimacy that heightens later loss, not sentimental filler.
- **Clear catastrophe mechanics**: horn -> impacts -> collapse -> missing.
