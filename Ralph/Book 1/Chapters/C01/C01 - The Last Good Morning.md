The morning comes the same way it always does in Emberfall — not with light, but with the deep, steady breath of the forges. Heat rising through stone. A low, constant thrum in the walls. Smoke in the seams.

November wakes before the bell, as he always does. No groan. No rolling. His eyes open, and he is already up, already here. It’s not discipline. It’s just how he’s built. Five hours and he is done with sleep, the way a sword is done with the whetstone.

Horus is still asleep beside him, a warm shape under a thin blanket, her hair a dark fan across the pillow. The room is small. A single cot. A low table. A kettle by the stove, cold ash inside it. A window that looks at another wall, close enough to touch if he leaned.

He sits on the edge of the cot and listens. The city is awake, though it hasn’t begun to move yet. In the gap before work, Emberfall is almost quiet. Almost.

Horus makes a sound in her sleep, a low hum, and he smiles without meaning to. It fades as fast as it comes. He stands and pulls on his pants, the linen thin and worn. He moves slow. The floor boards creak if you let them. He doesn’t.

A man learns where the soft spots are. In a room. In a day.

He fills the kettle with water from the clay pitcher and sets it on the coals. The stove gives a small hiss as the last embers wake. He watches the flame catch. It flickers like a stubborn thing, refusing to die because it remembers its job.

He washes his face at the basin, cold water, both hands, and is done. No mirror. No time for it. There is a small cut along his knuckle from yesterday, a slice from a practice blade. It’s thin and clean. He flexes the hand. It holds. He lets it be.

On the wall, near the door, his coat hangs beside a scuffed practice sword with a wrapped hilt. He ignores both for now.

He crosses to the window and cracks it an inch. The air is colder than the stone. It tastes of coal, iron, and something faintly sweet from the bakery three streets down. The smell tells him the time. Morning before the ovens are overworked, before the streets fill with men and sweat.

He steps back as Horus rolls and mumbles, then opens one eye.

“You’re a ghost,” she says.

“Would a ghost make tea?”

“Ghosts don’t do anything.”

“Then I’m not one.”

She sits up, pulling the blanket over her chest. She is not pretty in the easy, city market sense. She’s better. Strong shoulders. A scar along her forearm where a patient grabbed her and tore through skin. She has the kind of face that looks sharper when she’s tired, softer when she smiles. She smiles now, a small, crooked thing.

“Let me guess,” she says. “You slept five hours, woke up because the floorboards judged you, and now you’re about to go carry water for a man who isn’t awake yet.”

He shrugs.

“You could try sleeping in.”

“I could.”

“You won’t.”

“No.”

She lets her eyes close again and leans against him. Her head finds his shoulder like it’s a habit. It is.

He rests his cheek on her hair and stays still. The kettle whispers.

“What day is it,” she asks, drowsy.

“The one after yesterday.”

“That’s not a number.”

“It’s a truth.”

She laughs, small and tired. “You’re impossible in the mornings.”

“I’m impossible all the time.”

“Not to me.”

He says nothing. It sits between them in a way that doesn’t need words. There are a few moments like that. He holds them like coins.

She sits up again and rubs her eyes. “We’re on two rotations today. The Hall is already full.”

He nods. “I’ll be there.”

“I know.”

She swings her legs out, bare feet touching the cold floor, and shivers. He takes the blanket and wraps it around her shoulders. She lets him.

The kettle begins to rumble. He pours two cups with no ceremony. The tea is weak. It still warms his hands.

They drink in silence, the kind that only happens when there’s nothing to prove. Outside, the city finally clears its throat. Boots on stone. A cart wheel clattering. A distant shout, not angry, just getting someone’s attention.

He looks at the wall above the door. A nail there holds a strip of leather. On it, with ink that’s fading, are five lines.

We do not cheat.  
We do not lie.  
We do not abandon.  
Should death come seeking, we will not flinch — but neither will we seek it.  
We fight so those who cannot defend themselves have a defender.  
We are the flame in the night. The wall that does not break.  
We are the last line.

He doesn’t read it out loud. He doesn’t need to. It’s not a spell. It’s just a compass.

Horus follows his eyes and smiles. “You don’t have to keep that on the wall.”

“Then where?”

“In your head, like a normal person.”

“Then I’d forget it.”

She snorts. “You forget nothing.”

“I forget plenty.”

“Like?”

He thinks about it. “Names.”

“Mine?”

“Never.”

She shakes her head and leans into him, her shoulder bumping his. “You’re a problem.”

“Mm.”

She drinks the last of her tea and stands. The blanket falls. She doesn’t reach for it. She’s already moving, already dressing.

He watches her pull on her uniform coat, the brown healer’s canvas with its stitched symbol at the collar. The fabric is worn, patched in places. It has seen more blood than any armor.

He stands and slides his boots on, laces tight. He takes his coat. He doesn’t take the practice sword. He won’t be on the walls. Not yet. He’s a body in the Hall, another pair of hands, another man who can carry the wounded without dropping them. That matters more today.

They step into the corridor. The building is a stack of thin rooms and shared stairwells, a place that used to hold smiths before the lower ring shifted to housing. The air smells of soot and old soup. It’s familiar in a way that makes his shoulders loosen.

On the second landing, a child stumbles out of a door with a bucket too large for their arms. The bucket wobbles. Water sloshes. The child’s face is tight with effort.

November takes the bucket without a word and carries it down. The child keeps up, hands empty now, shoulders relaxing. At the ground floor, he sets it on the stone and nods to the child, who nods back and runs off.

Horus watches, amused. “You’re going to ruin that kid.”

“By carrying a bucket?”

“By making them think the world helps.”

“It does.”

“Sometimes.”

“Sometimes is enough.”

She holds his gaze for a beat. He lets it pass.

Outside, Emberfall is a mouth full of smoke. The street is already crowded. People move with purpose. There is no panic. There has been too much talk of war for panic to be new.

A set of posters is being tacked to a wall. A city herald is reading them out to a small cluster. November catches only the words “ration” and “rotation.” The rest is lost in the metal hiss of a nearby forge.

He and Horus move together, not hand in hand, but close. The crowd parts without thinking. He’s broad and steady. She has the healer’s patch. People make space.

At the corner, he stops at a public cistern and fills two small jugs. A woman beside him struggles with a heavy metal pail. He shifts the jug into his elbow and takes the pail with his free hand, lifts it, and sets it on her cart.

“Thank you,” she says.

He nods and moves on.

Horus shakes her head. “You’re going to run out of kindness by midday.”

“Then I’ll switch to water,” he says.

She snorts. “That doesn’t even make sense.”

“You asked for sarcasm.”

“That wasn’t sarcasm. That was a crime.”

They pass the butcher’s row, shutters still down. They pass the stone arch where, six months ago, he used to lean drunk and stare at his boots. The memory hits and is gone before it can root. He doesn’t linger. He doesn’t need to.

There is a moment, walking, where he catches his reflection in a shop window. A man with a thick beard, with eyes that have stopped fighting him. He sees the old version of himself in the glass for a split second — red-eyed, slack, fists half-clenched, body bending toward the ground. He watches it flicker and fade.

He is not that man. He isn’t ashamed of him either. That man kept him alive until he could be something else.

Horus nudges his shoulder. “You disappeared.”

“Just thinking.”

“About?”

“Nothing.”

She doesn’t push. She’s good at that.

They reach the Hall of the Fallen, a broad, low building of black stone with a copper spire that catches the little light Emberfall gets. The doors are open. The air inside smells of bleach, sweat, and old blood. Not the sharp metallic reek — the deep, lingering scent that clings to cloth and skin.

The hall is already alive with movement. Healers in brown move between cots. Novices bring water. A man with one arm stands at a table, sorting bandages into stacks with his remaining hand. He smiles at Horus as she passes. She smiles back, all business now.

“Stay out of the west wing,” she says to November. “They’re cleaning. Too much lye. You’ll cough your lungs up.”

“I like my lungs.”

“I know.”

She doesn’t ask him to be careful. Neither of them say things like that. She knows what he does, and he knows what she does, and they do it anyway.

He heads for the eastern row and lifts the first man who needs shifting. The cot is too small. The man is heavier than he looks. November grips under the shoulders and moves him with a careful, measured pull, letting the weight settle without jerking. The man hisses but doesn’t scream.

“Sorry,” November says.

“Don’t be.” The man’s voice is thick with pain.

He repeats the work. Lift. Carry. Set. Refill a water cup. Check a bandage for seep. Wipe a table clean with a rag and a splash of vinegar. Simple, unglamorous tasks.

It’s midmorning by the time he notices his back start to tighten. He rolls his shoulders once and keeps going. A novice shuffles past, arms full of linens. The boy is maybe fifteen. He looks at November like a man looks at a wall.

“You don’t have to carry that,” November says, taking half the stack.

The boy shakes his head. “I can.”

“I know,” November says, and carries half anyway.

He sees Horus down the row, bending over a cot, her hair falling forward. She doesn’t notice him. He watches the way her hands move — clean, fast, certain. He watches the way the man on the cot relaxes when her fingers touch his wrist.

He looks away. Something in his chest tightens and he doesn’t let it. He holds it down. He has had that tightness before, in worse places, with worse reasons. It doesn’t get to take the room.

A clang echoes down the hall — a dropped tray, not a bell — and everyone flinches. It happens a hundred times a day. It will happen a hundred more. The city is full of metal and metal noise. You learn which sounds matter.

Someone in the far row begins to cough. Not the wet cough of sickness, the dry cough of smoke. That’s new.

Horus meets his eyes across the room. She looks at him, then past him, toward the entrance. A faint vibration under the floorboards, like a cart rolling on stone. He feels it through his boots.

He stills, just for a heartbeat. That’s not a cart. Too slow.

Another faint vibration. Then a third. He listens. The city’s hum has shifted, but he can’t name how.

Horus walks over. “You feel that?”

“Yeah.”

“What is it?”

He doesn’t answer because a deep, horned sound cuts across the city. It is low and long, a single note that holds for too long to be human breath. The windows rattle. The hall goes still. Every head turns, like a field of wheat flattened by wind.

The horn ends. Silence. Then the horn again, shorter, urgent.

Horus swallows. “That’s not the shift bell.”

“No,” he says.

Somewhere outside, a shout begins. It gets picked up. Another. The sound spreads like fire across dry grass.

He moves to the door. Horus follows. The street outside has stopped. People stand in clusters, necks craning toward the wall. The forge smoke is thicker now, or the light has changed. He can’t tell.

A crack pops the air. Not close. Not far. It has the sharp edge of stone hitting stone.

He looks toward the skyline. The high wall of the outer ring rises in the distance, black against the dull sky. There is a bloom of dust near the gate, a puff that shouldn’t be there.

Then the siren goes again, a harsher sound, more mechanical than the horn. It makes the hair on his arms lift. He doesn’t know the siren. He didn’t need to.

People start to move, not running, but moving. Doors open. Windows slam. A mother pulls a child inside by the wrist, too hard.

Horus grips his sleeve. “We need to get the stretchers ready. Get the west wing open.”

He nods. He doesn’t ask why. The answer is already in the way the street is tightening.

They go back inside. November grabs a stack of folded cots and starts pushing them toward the west hall. He tries not to think too far ahead. He keeps it to the next step. The next load. The next breath.

Another crack, closer, followed by a low, rolling boom that you feel in the teeth more than the ears. Dust shakes loose from the rafters. A few people duck, though there is nothing falling.

The hall starts moving faster. Healers clear tables. Novices fetch water. The man with one arm grabs a rope and pulls a curtain across the entrance, not to block, but to manage.

Horus is already in the west wing, ordering with short, clipped commands. “Clear that. Move that. Get me clean cloth. Not that one. The other.”

She catches his eye and tosses him a hand signal for more cots. He gives a sharp nod and grabs two more stacks.

He is halfway across the hall when the first impact hits.

It is not the boom he expected. It is a tearing sound, like the sky itself ripping apart, followed by a concussion that shoves him sideways. The floor jerks. The windows explode inward in a storm of glass. He throws his shoulder against the cot stacks to stop them from toppling. The air is suddenly full of smoke and grit.

The hall goes dark for a second. Then the light comes back, pale and dusty. The smell hits — sulfur, burnt oil, and something that makes his stomach lurch.

People scream. Not in speech. In reflex. He hears a crash. A beam? A shelf? He can’t tell.

“Get down!” someone yells. Maybe him. Maybe not.

He pushes forward. The west wing door has swung shut. He slams into it and shoves. It gives. The west wing is a chaos of dust, the air too thick to breathe.

Another impact, farther away, but close enough that the floor jumps. He stumbles, catches himself on a doorway. The cot stacks have spilled across the floor, a mess of legs and linen.

He grabs a beam that has fallen, lifts one end, and drags it off a man pinned beneath. The man is alive, crying, blood running from his head. November speaks to him, but he can’t hear his own words.

Horus appears out of the haze. Her face is streaked with dust. There’s a cut on her cheek. She doesn’t seem to notice it.

“Back!” she yells, or he thinks she yells. Her mouth forms the shape of it. She points toward the hall entrance. He shakes his head. She grabs his sleeve and pulls. He pulls back. The world is noise. She looks at him and then, for the first time, a flicker of fear passes through her eyes.

He grips her forearm. He tries to say her name. The sound comes out thin.

The floor shudders again, harder. The wall to the left splits, a seam in the stone. Dust pours through it.

He is pulled backward by a surge of bodies. Someone slams into his shoulder. He loses his grip on Horus.

“No,” he says, but it’s not loud. It doesn’t matter.

He pushes against the crowd, but the crowd is pushing to live. He moves, not by his will, but by the weight of people pressed in panic.

Another roar. A pressure wave. The roof tilts. A heavy beam drops from above, slamming down in the doorway between him and the west wing. It explodes on impact, splinters and dust, a black wall of wood and smoke.

He stumbles, hits the ground, and crawls forward. The beam is too big. The stones around it have cracked. Dust is so thick he can’t see past his own hands.

“Horus!” He shouts it this time. The word is swallowed by the noise.

He drags himself toward the beam. Something hot grazes his arm. He flinches, keeps moving. There is a fire somewhere, small and hungry. He can smell it.

He reaches the beam and pushes. It doesn’t budge. He wedges his shoulder under and shoves. It shifts a hand’s width. He tries again. It moves another inch. A piece of stone skitters down, burning his palm. He swears and keeps his hand on it.

Behind him, someone screams his name. He turns. It’s the man with one arm. His face is bloody. He points toward the exit. The ceiling above is cracking. Bits of plaster fall like snow.

November looks back at the beam. He can’t see past it. He can’t hear her. He can’t tell if the air on the other side is even breathable.

He takes a breath and braces his feet. He pushes, muscle and will, but the beam is a dead thing and dead things are heavy.

The ceiling groans.

He lets go. It is not a choice. It is a calculation that feels like failure. He stands and moves back, pulled by hands, forced into the hall. He fights once, then stops. He will not die under a roof while there are people to carry.

The hall outside is a blur of movement and smoke. Cots have been overturned. Water sloshes across the floor. A man is crawling with one leg dragging behind him. He moves to the man, lifts him, and drags him toward the door. He feels the man’s weight like a penance.

At the entrance, the light is a grey wall. The street outside is gone. Or buried. Or both.

He steps into it and coughs. He tastes stone. The air is thick with dust and something chemical, a harsh tang that makes his eyes sting.

The street is chaos. The building across the way has lost its front. The edge of a siege engine’s projectile sits in the rubble, a black iron cylinder as thick as his torso, half buried in a crater. Steam rises from it. It ticks as it cools.

People run. Some toward the wall. Some away. No one knows which is correct.

He turns back to the Hall. The front corner has collapsed. The roof sags. The west wing is not visible, just a mound of smoke.

“Horus!” he shouts. He can hear his own voice now, ragged and raw.

No answer.

He pushes toward the entrance, but a healer grips his coat. “We need you here,” she says. Her face is smeared with blood. He doesn’t recognize her.

“I need—”

“There’s another one coming,” she says, and points skyward.

He looks up. There is a dark shape arcing through the grey, slow and heavy, falling toward the lower ring.

He turns back. He doesn’t run. He moves with purpose to a group of wounded, pulls one man onto a door that’s being used as a stretcher. He and another man carry it, stepping over rubble, toward the clinic across the street.

The second impact hits a block away. The shock wave knocks him sideways. He holds the stretcher anyway. The man on it groans. The other carrier falls. November kneels, steadies the stretcher, and then lifts the other man by his collar.

“Get up,” he says.

The man looks at him with eyes wide and empty. November holds him until his feet find the ground.

They carry the stretcher again. They reach the clinic, drop the wounded inside, and turn back. November’s lungs burn. His eyes water. He keeps moving.

He goes back to the Hall’s entrance and looks into the smoke. He can’t see more than a few feet. The beam is still there, a dark bar of wood and stone. The world feels narrow, like the air itself is pressing in.

He steps forward. A hand catches his sleeve. It’s the one-armed man again. “No.”

“She’s inside,” November says.

The man’s eyes flicker. “We’re all inside,” he says, and then, “If you go in, you’ll be inside forever.”

November swallows. His throat is dry and gritty. He thinks of Horus’s hand on his sleeve this morning. The warmth. The way her head found his shoulder like it belonged there.

He looks toward the door and takes a step.

Another crack. The roof shifts. A cloud of dust surges, thicker than before. The hall’s front wall collapses a little more, stones rolling into the street.

He steps back. The air is unbreathable. The sound of the city is nothing but impact and the low, constant siren.

He stands in the street, chest rising and falling, and for a second, he is still. Not frozen. Just still. The world narrows to the space between his ribs. He feels a pull deep in him, a place that wants to break loose. He holds it. He holds it like a fist around a blade.

He forces himself to move. He turns, not away, but toward the line of wounded, toward the need. He lifts another man. He carries another stretcher. He moves.

He does not look back again until he has to.

When he does, the Hall is a broken shape behind him. The smoke eats its edges. No movement in the doorway. No voice.

He stands and looks until his eyes blur. Then another impact hits somewhere beyond the ring. The ground shakes. He’s brought back to the work. He bends, picks up a dropped bucket, and passes it to a trembling novice.

He doesn’t feel the tears. He doesn’t have any.

He only feels the weight of the air and the fact that she is not in front of him. That is the only math he can do right now.

The siren fades. The street is a grey tunnel. The world is smoke and stone.

Silence and smoke.
