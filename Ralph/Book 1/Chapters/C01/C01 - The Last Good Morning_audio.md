November woke before the bell.

Not from habit alone. From the way the room went still. The way the building settled. From the absence of noise he could not name, the faint pause between night and day when the city inhaled and held it.

He lay on his back. One hand on his chest. Eyes open. Listening. Footsteps above. A door two rooms over. A cart wheel outside, soft on stone, the driver humming without words. Nothing urgent. The old part of him would have gone searching for a bottle just to fill the silence. This one let the silence sit. He counted five slow breaths and sat up.

Horus was already awake. She sat on the edge of the bed, hair tied back with a strip of linen, pulling on her boots. Her tunic was simple. Gray. A stain at the hem she never quite got out. When she noticed him, she didn't smile. She raised a brow like he'd been caught doing something.

[annoyed] "You're late," she said.

He glanced at the small clock on the shelf. [calm] "I'm three minutes early."

[annoyed] "That's late for you."

[sarcastic] "Then we should fire me."

[chuckles] "Done. I'll hire the next drunk in the alley. He'll be cheaper."

He rubbed his face, then his eyes. The joke sat between them. Familiar. Warm.

She tossed him his shirt. He caught it. [concerned] "You should be asleep," he said.

[sarcastic] "And miss your riveting morning routine? No."

He pulled the shirt on, then tied his boots. The laces were frayed. He'd meant to replace them. He'd meant to do a lot of things.

He stood and stretched. The scar on his rib pulled. It had been two months and it still felt new. Some nights it itched. He didn't scratch.

Horus stood, rolled her shoulders, and reached for the small basin. She splashed water on her face and wiped it dry with a cloth that had once been white. She glanced at him while she did it.

[thoughtful] "You sleep," she said.

[even] "It works."

[skeptical] "It shouldn't."

[even] "It does."

She set the cloth down. [serious] "It's a war, not a contest."

He looked at her. [quietly] "I know."

He wasn't lying. She didn't push.

They moved in their practiced way. He filled the kettle from the jug. She set the bread on the board. He cut it. She poured the tea. They sat and ate without speaking much. They didn't have to fill every empty space. They didn't have to explain the quiet to each other.

He watched her while she drank. The tendon in her wrist flexed. A faint, pale scar ran along her thumb, old and smooth. She had a dozen like it. Small cuts and burns that healed into a map no one else could read.

[matter-of-fact] "You're on the early shift," he said.

[resigned] "I'm always on the early shift."

[even] "Because you volunteer."

[firm] "Because they need me."

He didn't argue. She was right. But he didn't like that she was right.

He reached for the crust of bread and held it between his fingers while he spoke. [gentle] "I'll walk you."

She studied him for a beat. [thoughtful] "You don't need to."

[soft] "I want to."

[resigned] "Fine."

He smiled once. Not big. Just enough.

They stood. He collected the kettle and poured the last of the hot water into the basin. He washed his face and neck. He used the same cloth she had. He didn't waste water. He dried his hands on his trousers.

Horus tightened the strap on her satchel. It was heavy. It always was. Her hands lingered on it, like she was checking it for a pulse.

[concerned] "You sure you want the pack today?" he asked.

[resigned] "I don't get to choose."

[offering] "I can carry it."

She gave him a look. [exasperated] "You carry enough."

He didn't insist. The line between kindness and pride was thin. He tried not to step on it.

They left the room. The hall smelled of damp stone and old smoke. It was early, but the building wasn't asleep. Two apprentices passed them with a crate. An older woman swept the floor, her back bent like a question mark. She nodded at Horus. She ignored him, then looked again and gave a small nod too. A month ago, she hadn't.

Outside, Emberfall was gray and waking. The first light bled through the soot, thin and weak. Chimney smoke rose in slow plumes from the black iron stacks. Somewhere, a forge bellows wheezed like a tired animal. The street underfoot was uneven, pocked from old repairs. The smell was metal, coal, and bread.

He held the door for her. She stepped out into the cold. The air had teeth.

They turned toward the Hall of the Fallen. The streets were narrow here, hemmed in by soot-stained stone. The city had been built to hold heat and then left to fend for itself. In the morning, it was cold. By midday, it would be a furnace.

A boy ran past them with a basket. He almost collided with Horus, caught himself, mumbled an apology, and kept going. She watched him disappear around a corner.

[matter-of-fact] "He's going to trip on the third step," she said.

[dry] "He always does."

[challenging] "Bet?"

He shook his head. [teasing] "I'm saving my money for your shoes."

She glanced at her boots, then back at him. [defensive] "My shoes are fine."

[teasing] "They were fine before you patched them the third time."

She stopped for a heartbeat. [wry] "Your boots are held together by hope."

He looked down. [deadpan] "Hope is sturdy." They kept walking.

A soldier leaned against a wall, helmet at his feet, rubbing his temples. The dark circles under his eyes were old. He wasn't bleeding. He was just tired. November slowed, reached into his pocket, and pulled a strip of dried meat from the wrapping he'd saved from last night. He held it out.

The soldier looked up, surprised. [embarrassed] "I can't."

[gentle] "It's just food."

He took it anyway. [grateful] "Thanks." November nodded and moved on.

Horus watched him. [concerned] "You keep doing that and you'll run out."

[dry] "Then I'll go hungry."

[firm] "Don't."

[defensive] "It was extra."

[flat] "It wasn't."

He shrugged. [casual] "There's more where it came from."

There wasn't. But she knew how to argue with him, so she let it go. She knew when to let it go.

They reached a cross street. The road opened a little here, wide enough for two carts to pass. It was busy already. Civilians, workers, a handful of legionnaires moving in pairs. No banners. No speeches. The war was somewhere else. The city only felt it in the way people moved, in the empty places at tables, in the extra cots in the Hall.

November's eyes slid over the faces. He noticed small things: a woman with a bandaged hand, a kid with a soldier's jacket that was too big, a man carrying water with one shoulder lower than the other. He didn't linger. He kept walking.

Horus said nothing. She knew his mind had that habit, the way it took inventory. She didn't ask him to stop.

They turned down a stairway that led into the lower ring. The air changed, thickening with forge smoke. The Hall of the Fallen sat at the bottom, long and low, with a slate roof and wide doors that were always open.

There were people on the steps. They weren't patients. They were waiting. They looked up when they saw Horus and made a path without being asked.

She nodded as she passed. She didn't smile. She didn't have time. They didn't need it. They needed her to keep moving.

At the door, she turned to him. The city behind him was waking now. The first bell had rung. A thin sound, almost pretty. It was hard to believe it was meant to mark a day that might end in blood.

[offering] "I can come in," he said.

She considered. [firm] "Not today."

[curious] "Why?"

She smiled then, small and tired. [tired] "Because if you come in, you'll start helping. And if you start helping, you'll be here all day. And I need you out there."

He frowned. [concerned] "Out where?"

She leaned closer and touched his chest with two fingers. [serious] "In the city. In the places I'm not."

He looked down at her fingers and then back up at her. The Creed sat behind his eyes. He didn't say it. He didn't have to. It lived in his hands, in the way he stepped in front of a stranger without thinking.

[quietly] "Okay," he said.

She nodded. [warm] "I'll see you at mid."

[wry] "Unless you work through."

[resigned] "I'll try."

He knew what try meant. He let it stand.

She stood on her toes and kissed him, fast and practiced. When she pulled back, her eyes held his for a second longer than the moment required. Then she was gone into the Hall.

He stood there for a breath. He could go inside anyway. He could pretend he needed something. He could find a reason to stay. He didn't. He turned away from the door and walked back up the steps.

Outside, he blinked against the light. It had grown, not brighter, just more present. A wash of gray.

He took the long way back. He did it often. It let him see more. It let him help more. It let him feel like he was doing something with the hours between now and mid.

He crossed past the fish market. The stalls were half-open. A man with a missing ear scraped frost off a plank and cursed under his breath. November stepped in, took the scraper from his hand, and finished the line. The man looked at him, annoyed, then grateful. He said nothing. November handed the tool back and moved on.

At the well, a woman struggled with a bucket. She was small. The bucket was full. She had the rope wrapped around her wrist, digging in. November stepped forward and took the weight.

[protesting] "I can," she protested.

[gentle] "You did. Now I will."

She huffed. [amused] "Stubborn."

[deadpan] "Correct."

He lifted the bucket and carried it to the edge. He set it down gently.

[grateful] "Thanks," she said. He nodded and walked away.

He didn't keep track. He didn't need to. It wasn't a ledger. It was a habit.

He passed two men arguing over a cart wheel. The axle was cracked. One insisted it could be patched. The other said it needed replacing. Their voices rose. November paused, listened, then walked on. He didn't have a solution. He didn't force one. Not every problem was his.

He ended up near the training yard. He hadn't planned it, but his feet knew the path. The yard was mostly empty at this hour. Two soldiers ran drills with practice swords. Their movements were clean. Their feet didn't waste energy. November watched for a moment. Then he stepped into a corner and pulled his own blade from the wrap he carried.

It was a borrowed sword. It wasn't his. It fit his hand anyway. The blade was dull. He kept it that way. He didn't trust himself with sharp when he didn't need it.

He ran through the basics. Stance. Grip. A cut that felt too wide. He corrected. He moved again. His footwork was still sloppy. He felt it every time his weight shifted. He adjusted. He tried again. He wasn't thinking about war. He was thinking about the line of his wrist.

A voice behind him. [easy] "You're up early."

He turned. It was Taron, a veteran from the gate garrison. The man had lost two fingers and kept his sense of humor. He carried a spear in one hand like it weighed nothing.

[flat] "Couldn't sleep," November said.

Taron looked him over. [dry] "You never can."

[defensive] "I sleep fine."

[skeptical] "Sure."

Taron stepped into the yard and took up a position across from him. [casual] "A few passes?"

November hesitated. [polite] "I don't want to hold you."

[grim] "I'm not busy. Nobody is. Not yet." They moved.

Taron didn't go easy on him. He never did. He didn't have to. The point wasn't to win. The point was to feel the gap between himself and someone who had been trained. November felt it every time the spear's tip ghosted past his ribs.

He didn't beat Taron. He didn't come close. He got hit twice. He corrected. He got hit again. He got a clean touch once, a slash to the spear shaft that would have been a cut if it were a sword.

Taron grunted. [gruff] "Better."

[skeptical] "Is that true or are you being kind?"

[flat] "I'm not kind."

November nodded. [dry] "Then I'll take it."

They stopped. Taron rested the spear against his shoulder. [serious] "The wall's going to want you soon."

[even] "I'm not enlisted."

[grim] "That doesn't matter when the orcs arrive."

He didn't answer. He didn't have a plan beyond today. He had a plan for the next hour. He had a plan for seeing Horus at mid.

Taron wiped his brow. [cautious] "You hear the rumors?"

[even] "No."

[flat] "Good."

Taron looked past him. [firm] "Go. Don't get stuck in the yard. This place will be full soon."

November wrapped his blade and tied the cord. [even] "I'll see you."

[guarded] "Maybe."

He left the yard. He kept walking.

He passed the old distillery. The door was ajar. The smell hit him like a fist. Burnt grain. Yeast. That sharp, sweet edge that used to feel like relief. He slowed, then stopped.

He could step inside. He could ask for a job. He could tell himself he was just checking. The thought came and passed. He watched it go the way you watch a cart wheel roll away down a slope. He turned and kept walking.

The old him would have gone in. The old him would have justified it. The old him would have woken the next day with a headache and a regret he would pretend wasn't there. He wasn't that man now. He didn't have to pretend about it. He just wasn't.

He stopped at a small shrine on the corner. The stones were dark and pitted. Someone had left a candle, burned to a stub. He didn't light one. He didn't say a prayer. He touched the edge of the stone with his fingertips and moved on.

By the time he reached the lower ring again, the city was fully awake. The air hummed with labor. The forge bells rang. The smell of coal was thicker. He could taste it.

He checked the sun. Mid was still a while away. He found a low wall and sat, rested his back against it. He closed his eyes.

He let his mind go quiet. Not asleep, not thinking. Just still.

A shout pulled him back. Two men argued over a sack of grain. One accused the other of stealing. The accused denied it. The voices rose.

November opened his eyes. He watched. He didn't move. It wasn't that he didn't care. It was that he was learning where to put his weight. He couldn't fix everything. He could get killed trying. He knew that now. The argument ended with a shove and a curse. No blade. No blood. The men separated. He let out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding. He stood and moved on.

He found a barrel leaking water. The wood was split at a seam. He tightened the iron band with a stone. The leak slowed. Not fixed. Slowed. It was enough for now.

He reached the Hall of the Fallen a little before mid. The steps were crowded. More than earlier. A man with a bandaged thigh was carried inside. A woman with soot on her cheeks sat on the steps with her head in her hands. Horus was at the door, speaking with another healer. Her hair was looser now. A wisp had escaped the tie and stuck to her forehead.

She saw him and lifted her chin. [tired] "You're early."

[teasing] "You're late."

She wiped her hands on her apron. [matter-of-fact] "It isn't mid."

[wry] "It is for me."

She sighed. [checking] "You ate?"

[even] "Yes."

[checking] "Water?"

[even] "Yes."

She narrowed her eyes. [stern] "Don't lie."

He held up his hands. [light] "No lie. I drank. I ate. I didn't argue with anyone. I'm a model citizen."

She stepped closer and looked at his forearm. A faint scrape there. She pressed it with her thumb.

[defensive] "It doesn't hurt."

[dry] "It will."

[defiant] "I can handle it."

She took a rag from her satchel and dabbed a bit of salve on the scrape. It stung. He didn't flinch.

[firm] "You can handle it," she said, [firm] "but you still treat it." He nodded.

They stood for a moment while the traffic moved around them.

[observant] "You were at the yard," she said.

[curious] "How do you know?"

[dry] "You smell like dust and sweat."

He breathed out. [resigned] "Fine. Yes."

She looked him over again. [checking] "You didn't get hit hard."

[wry] "Not hard enough."

She glanced toward the street. [serious] "The wall's going to call."

[guarded] "Maybe."

[firm] "You should be there when it does."

He didn't answer. He knew what she wanted. He knew what he wanted.

She gave him a small look, the one that meant she was trying to stay patient. [soft] "We don't get to choose which days are quiet."

[even] "I know."

She touched his cheek with the back of her fingers. [gentle] "Stay out of trouble."

[dry] "I've been doing that for months."

[wry] "That's why I'm saying it."

He smiled. [warm] "See you at end."

[warns] "Try not to be a martyr."

[even] "I'm not."

[firm] "Try anyway." He nodded.

She turned and went back inside. He watched her go. He did it every time. He didn't know why. Maybe to memorize the way she walked. Maybe because the city had a habit of taking people without notice. He turned away before he could get stupid.

He walked toward the middle ring. He didn't head for the wall. He kept to the streets, listening. The city felt different now. A tension under the noise. The air tasted wrong. He didn't know why.

He passed a group of children playing with a hoop. Their laughter sounded strange in the soot. An older man watched them from a doorway, eyes hard and soft at once.

November stopped beside them, knelt, and set the hoop upright when it fell. He spun it back. The smallest boy grinned at him with missing teeth. November nodded and stood. He kept moving.

At a corner, a cart had lost a wheel. A man cursed and strained at the axle. November stepped in, lifted the back of the cart with his shoulder while the man shoved the wheel back on. It wasn't elegant. It worked.

[gruff] "You're not getting paid," the man said.

[even] "I know."

[gruff] "You should." November shrugged and stepped away.

He found himself near the east corridor, a narrow stretch that led toward the outer ring. He wasn't supposed to be there. No sign said so, but the looks from the patrol told him. He didn't push. He turned back.

He felt it then. A tremor, so slight it could have been a cart rolling. The ground gave a tiny shiver and then stopped.

He paused. People around him didn't seem to notice. A woman adjusted her basket. A soldier laughed at something his friend said. The city carried on. He kept walking, but his skin stayed tight.

The first horn sounded a minute later. It wasn't a signal inside the city. It was distant. Low and long. The sound of something huge and hollow. It came from outside the walls.

Conversations halted. Heads turned. A couple of people laughed nervously. Most didn't.

November stopped in the street. He looked toward the outer ring. He couldn't see the wall from here. The buildings were too close, too tall. But he heard the horn again. Then another.

He moved. Not running. Not yet. He turned onto a wider street that would take him to a rise where he could see the gate if he wanted. He didn't go that far. He cut right, toward the Hall. He didn't need a view. He needed Horus.

He reached the steps. The doors were crowded now. A healer shouted instructions. A runner pushed past with a list in his hand. Horus wasn't in sight. He stepped inside.

The Hall was all stone and shadows. Cots lined the walls. They were empty now. He spotted Horus near the back, washing her hands again. She looked up when she saw him. Her eyes were sharp. No fear. Not yet.

[stern] "You're not supposed to be in here," she said.

[urgent] "There's a horn."

[flat] "There's always a horn."

[insistent] "This one's different."

She looked past him toward the door. [serious] "It might be."

He stepped closer. [urgent] "Do you need me?"

[firm] "Not here." She gestured toward the entrance. [commanding] "Outside. Make yourself useful."

He held her gaze. [concerned] "Stay close to the door."

[firm] "I'll be where I'm needed."

That was the answer he expected. He nodded once. He turned to leave.

The second sound wasn't a horn. It was a deep, blunt boom. It came from far away. The Hall shook. Dust drifted from the rafters. The cots rattled.

A beat of silence followed, then a low rumble as if the city exhaled.

The healers froze for a breath. Then the room moved. People started talking all at once. Someone shouted orders. Another called for the stretchers.

November looked at Horus. She had gone still, hands wet, jaw set. She met his eyes. In them, he saw what he felt but hadn't named. This was it. He turned and ran.

Outside, the street had changed. People were moving now, not walking. A few ran toward the inner ring. A few ran toward the outer. Most just stood and listened.

He pushed through, headed toward the rise. He needed to see. He didn't want to, but he needed to.

He reached the turn and the street opened to a view of the wall beyond the rooftops. A faint haze drifted above it. Not smoke from the forges. This was darker. Thicker. It climbed slow, like something waking.

Another boom. This one closer. The ground jumped under his feet. A child screamed. November's ears rang.

He turned back toward the Hall. He was already moving when the world went white.

The blast hit from the east. He didn't see the impact. He felt it. A punch through the air. A wall of heat. The sound tore across the street like a blade.

He was lifted. For a heartbeat he hung, weightless. Then he hit stone. The back of his head struck first. Light burst behind his eyes. The air left him.

He tried to breathe and couldn't. Dust filled his mouth. He rolled onto his side and coughed. The street was gone. Or it was there, but it wasn't the same. Broken. Tilted. Someone screamed. Someone else didn't.

He pushed himself up on his elbows. The world wavered. He closed his eyes and opened them again. The view steadied a little.

The Hall of the Fallen was half-hidden behind a curtain of gray. The front wall had cracked. Stone lay in the street. A cart was on its side, one wheel still spinning. A man crawled from under it, blood on his face.

November tried to stand. His legs shook. He planted his hands on the ground and pushed. He got one knee under him, then the other. He stood. He swayed. He steadied himself with a hand against a broken wall. His palm came away red. He looked. It wasn't his. He moved toward the Hall.

[urgent] "November." A voice. He turned. An apprentice from the Hall, face white with dust, waved him over. [shouts] "Help!"

He stepped that way, then stopped. His eyes caught on the Hall doors.

They were blocked by debris. The entrance had buckled. A chunk of stone the size of a cart sat in front of it. The left door hung from one hinge.

[shouts] "Horus!" he shouted. His voice came out rough, swallowed by the smoke. No answer.

He ran to the debris and tried to lift it. It didn't move. He wedged his fingers under a smaller slab and heaved. It shifted. He pulled it free and tossed it aside.

Another boom in the distance. The air thudded. A shower of dust fell from the roof. He flinched and kept moving.

He forced his way through the broken doorway. Inside, the light was dim. Dust turned the air into fog. He coughed and wiped his eyes. The cots were overturned. A stretcher lay on its side. A lantern had fallen and gone out.

[shouts] "Horus!" he called again.

[weak] "Here." A voice from the left. Not hers. He moved toward it and saw a healer pinned under a beam. He shoved the beam with his shoulder. It lifted enough for her to crawl free. She gasped and coughed, then staggered away.

He turned, searching. The Hall was chaos. People moving, calling, bleeding. He pushed through.

[shouts] "Horus!" No answer.

He went toward the back. The wash basin was cracked. Water spilled across the floor. A satchel lay open, contents strewn.

He found her apron. It was torn at the hem. It was on the floor.

He followed his instinct, the way he did in fights when his eyes and hands took over. He moved through the Hall and into the back corridor.

The corridor was darker. A beam had fallen across it, blocking most of the path. He squeezed under it. His shoulder scraped wood. He didn't care.

He reached the back room. It was empty. The shelves had toppled. Glass lay everywhere. He stepped carefully and still cut his hand. No Horus.

He went back, faster, shouting her name as he ran. He searched the Hall again. He checked the cots. He asked people who were moving, who were bleeding, who were breathing. None had seen her. One shook her head. One pointed toward the front. None had seen her.

He went back outside. The street was worse. Smoke had thickened. The light was a gray smear. The air tasted like metal. Ash floated down in slow spirals.

He ran to the steps, scanning the street. He couldn't see her. He saw a healer carrying a child. He saw a soldier with a broken arm. He saw a man kneeling in the rubble, hands in his hair. He didn't see Horus.

He ran toward the corner where he had left her. The path was blocked. A wall had fallen. He climbed it. The stones were hot.

He dropped down on the other side. The ground shook again. He staggered.

[shouts] "Horus!" he shouted. Still nothing.

He looked back toward the Hall. More people poured out. Some ran in. The Hall was a mouth that swallowed and spat. He could not see into it now. The smoke was too thick.

He forced his breathing to steady. He scanned the faces. None were hers. He ran.

He ran toward the lower ring. He ran toward the places she might have gone. He ran toward any shadow that looked like her shape. He did not find her.

A siren wailed, closer now, sharper, a high sound that cut through the smoke. It rose and fell. It told the city what it already knew.

He stopped in the middle of the street. He bent, hands on his knees, and tried to breathe.

He lifted his head. Smoke drifted past him in slow waves. The city was quieter than it should have been. The noise had thinned. The people were moving, but the sound was muffled, like the world had put a cloth over its mouth.

He looked back toward the Hall one more time. He couldn't see it.

He stood in the street, alone, and the smoke closed around him. Silence and smoke.
