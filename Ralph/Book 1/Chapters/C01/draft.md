Before I draft C01, I need a couple specifics to align with your structure and rules.

1. Which POV starts C01, and on what day?  
2. Where in Emberfall does C01 open (exact location and moment)?  
3. Any must-hit beats or scenes you want in C01 (besides the siege opening)?  

Once I have those, I’ll draft the full 3,000–5,000 words.
