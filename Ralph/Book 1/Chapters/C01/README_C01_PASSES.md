# C01 Draft Passes (Up To v5_4)

This README documents what can be verified on disk about the pass history that produced:

- `Ralph/Book 1/Chapters/C01/C01 - The Last Good Morning_v5_4.md`

## Verified On Disk

## Pass History (Unverified)
Earlier draft passes (e.g., `_v2`, `_v3`, `_v4`, `_v5`, `_v5_1`, `_v5_2`, `_v5_3`) are **not present on disk** at the moment, so I cannot verify or summarize what changed between those versions.

If you have those files elsewhere, place them back into:
`Ralph/Book 1/Chapters/C01/`
and I can generate a precise diff-based pass history.

## What I Can Produce Next
- A **diff summary** between all available versions (if you restore them).
- A **timeline** of edits based on file timestamps and diffs.
- A **change log** from `_v2` → `_v5_4` if earlier drafts are provided.

## Notes
- The TTS workflow details are documented in:
  - `Ralph/Book 1/Chapters/C01/README_TTS.md`

If you want a full pass history, point me to the missing draft files or tell me where they were stored.
