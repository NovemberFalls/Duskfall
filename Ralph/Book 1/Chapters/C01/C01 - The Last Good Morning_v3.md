November woke before the bells.

It wasn’t the bells that pulled him up anymore. It was his body. Five hours, give or take. He’d learned to trust it. When the dark inside him settled, he slept. When it lifted, he was awake. It was quiet in the room, a narrow slice of morning light on the floor, dust in it like slow ash.

He lay still for a moment, listening. Pipes hissed somewhere deeper in the building. A cart rolled over cobbles outside. The city’s furnace-breath was soft at this hour, a low, steady growl instead of the full roar of day. He could hear Horus breathing beside him.

He turned his head and watched her, the way she slept with her hair loose, one arm thrown above her head like she owned the bed and the morning. He smiled without thinking and then kept it to himself. She had a way of knowing when he was looking. If she was awake, she’d say something about it. If she was asleep, he didn’t want to be the reason she wasn’t.

He eased out of bed. Floorboards creaked under his weight, old wood held together by iron nails and stubbornness. He found his pants, his shirt, and his boots by memory. The laces were frayed; everything in Emberfall was frayed. He pulled them tight anyway.

The basin in the corner was half full. He poured a thin line of water over his hands, rubbed them clean of sleep. It was cold, or maybe his fingers still thought they were. He was halfway through splashing his face when he felt the bed shift behind him.

“Stop moving like an ox and it won’t creak.” Horus’s voice was the kind that cut through a room without raising itself. Warm. Dry. Awake.

He looked over his shoulder and she was propped on her elbow, hair in a tangle, eyes half open. She wore one of his shirts, long enough to make it decent, not long enough to make it fair.

He shrugged. “If you want a quiet lover, find a thief.”

She smiled. “If I wanted a quiet lover I’d have picked a corpse.”

That got a low breath of a laugh out of him. It felt good. It felt clean. He rinsed his face and wiped it on the sleeve.

“I can be quiet,” he said. “Watch.”

She waited.

He didn’t move.

“You’re still breathing too loud,” she said.

He rolled his eyes and reached for the pitcher. It was almost empty. He checked it twice like that would help. “We’re low.”

“You’re always low.”

“Not on water.”

She sat up, pulled the shirt down at the hem, eyes on him. “Bring back bread. We’ll call that even.”

He glanced at the small coin pile on the table and then at her. “Bread and water.”

“And a little sweet if you find it.” She said it with the same voice she used when she asked for bandages or herbs. She was not asking. She was stating a need and expecting him to handle it. He liked that about her.

He crossed the room, leaned down and kissed her forehead. “I’ll find it.”

Her hand caught his wrist as he straightened. Her fingers were warm. “Don’t pick a fight.”

He paused. She didn’t mean the way the words sounded. She meant: keep your head. Keep your body. Keep yourself intact. He didn’t fight unless someone dragged it to his door. She knew that. Still, she said it.

He squeezed her hand once. “I won’t.”

She watched him for a moment longer, then let him go. “Bring a coat. The air’s angry today.”

“Air’s always angry,” he said.

“That’s your optimistic side.”

He did bring the coat.

The stairwell smelled like old smoke and boiled metal. Emberfall was a city built on heat and sweat; it never cooled, even in the morning. He took the steps two at a time, not because he was in a hurry, but because he hated wasting motion. People were starting to move outside. He passed a pair of apprentices carrying tool bundles, heads down. He nodded. They nodded back.

On the street, the sky was gray with dawn. The forges on the lower ring were already alive, sending up columns of smoke that smeared the light. Somewhere a rooster tried to cut through the din and failed. There was a low hum of voices and the scrape of carts. It felt like any other morning, if you let it. If you didn’t look too far up, toward the walls.

November kept his eyes level. He wasn’t avoiding the walls. He didn’t have to. They were there whether he looked at them or not. So was everything beyond them.

He walked the main line toward the well, boots loud on the stone. The city was built to hold bodies, not whispers. He passed a baker rolling up his shutters, the smell of bread already peeking out from inside. He checked his coin again and kept walking. Water first.

The well sat in the square, a stone mouth with a broken iron rail around it. There were three people already waiting, the regulars who rose early and didn’t trust the line to stay short. November stepped behind an older woman with a cloth tied around her hair. She looked back and gave him a brief, tired smile.

“You’re up early.”

He nodded. “Couldn’t sleep.”

That wasn’t a lie, not exactly. He could always sleep. The choice wasn’t about ability. It was about what he wanted to do with the time. He listened to the water creak up in someone else’s bucket. He could feel his body humming in that quiet way it did after sleep, the clean readiness of it. No drink burned in his throat. No fog in his skull. Six months ago the morning would have been something he survived. Now it was something he used.

When it was his turn, he set his bucket and cranked. The chain rattled, old metal on old wood. He pulled the bucket up, let it drip for a moment, and poured it into his own. He didn’t fill it to the brim. He didn’t need to spill on the walk.

A little boy staggered across the square with a bucket too big for him, the water sloshing with every step. His jaw was set, like he’d already decided he wasn’t going to fall. He was about to. November closed the gap without thinking, caught the bucket at the last second, steadied it.

The boy looked up, eyes wide. “I can—”

“I saw you,” November said. “You can. I just like the weight.”

He held the bucket while the boy repositioned his hands. The kid’s fingers were red from the cold. He watched the boy adjust, then eased his own hands away. The kid kept it. He gave November a quick nod and walked on like nothing had happened.

November didn’t smile. It wasn’t a moment to celebrate. It was just what you did. He took his own bucket and started for home.

He didn’t get all the way. Half a block from the well, he saw Toma by the alley, crouched over a broken cart. Toma was a carpenter with more joints than patience. He’d been trying to make the same cart roll for a week.

“Wheel’s still a bastard?” November asked.

Toma looked up. “It’s the axle.”

“Yeah. That’s what I said.”

“Axle’s not a wheel.”

“It is if you’re under it.”

Toma grunted, more agreement than humor. November set his bucket down and crouched. The axle was bent and the wheel was pulling against it at a sick angle. He didn’t have tools. He had hands.

“Hold the cart,” he said.

Toma grabbed the frame. November lifted the front, put his weight into it. His shoulders complained, then held. Toma pulled the axle free enough to twist it back into line, his fingers working with a quickness that didn’t match his age.

“More,” Toma said.

November lifted higher, the edge of the cart pressing into his palms. The wood was rough, splintered. He held it anyway. He could feel the pulse in his forearms.

“Now,” Toma said.

He drove the axle in. The wheel dropped, just a little, then caught. It spun once, a clean rotation. Toma let out a breath he’d been holding too long.

“Thanks,” he said.

November lowered the cart and stood. “Keep the wheel for now,” he said. “Get a new axle when you can.”

Toma shook his head. “I can’t.”

November stared at the cart, then at Toma. He reached into his pocket, pulled out two coins, placed them on the cart’s broken lip. Toma started to protest.

“Keep it,” November said.

“November—”

“I’ve got bread money.” He didn’t mention the sweet. He didn’t mention Horus. He didn’t make it a thing.

Toma stared at the coins like they might vanish if he blinked. Then he tucked them away without a word. The lack of thanks was its own kind of respect. November picked up his bucket and kept walking.

He didn’t need to think about the old him. The old him still existed. He just didn’t live there anymore. He’d learned that he could look in the mirror and see a man who’d made mistakes and not have to drown in them. Not forget. Not forgive. Just carry. It was a kind of discipline, like keeping your sword clean even when it was the last thing you wanted to do.

He passed a pair of Legionnaires on patrol. Their armor was scuffed, their eyes bloodshot. One had a bandage around his hand. The other was chewing something he didn’t want to describe.

“Mornin’,” the chewing one said.

November nodded. “You up all night?”

“Yeah,” the other said. “Gate inspection.”

November held their gaze for a second too long. It wasn’t a challenge. It was a check. They looked tired but sharp. Good. He moved on.

By the time he returned, the room was brighter. Horus had dressed. She sat at the table with a bundle of bandages at her side, sorting them by size without looking. She did it by feel, her fingers quick and certain.

“You didn’t bring a coat,” she said.

“I did.”

She glanced up, saw it on his shoulder, and gave him a look that said she already knew.

He set the bucket on the table. “Water.”

She slid it toward her side, then nodded at his empty hands. “Bread?”

“I’ll get it.”

“And the sweet.”

He set his coin pile on the table and spread it with two fingers, showing the missing pieces. “Gave Toma two.”

Her brows lifted. “How much does bread cost where you live?”

“I’ll get it,” he repeated.

Horus watched him for a moment. “If you give away the last two, I’m going to tie you to the bed.”

That got a real smile out of him. He reached for her bandage pile, found the rough ends that always caught on things, and smoothed them down.

“I’m not giving away the last two,” he said. “I’m just borrowing from myself.”

“Self-borrowing is still stealing.”

“Then arrest me.”

She tossed a bandage at his head. He caught it. “Criminal,” she said.

He grabbed the small pouch for coins and reached for the door. “Back soon.”

“Don’t be a hero,” she said.

He paused. It was the second time she’d used that word. He looked back at her, then at the bandages. “You’re the one who keeps pulling broken people out of ditches.”

She held his gaze. “That’s different.”

“It’s not.”

She sighed, soft and tired. “Go.”

He went.

The baker was open when he got there. The man behind the counter looked like he’d spent a lifetime under heat; his skin was the same color as his loaves.

“Morning,” the baker said.

“Two small. One crusty,” November said.

The baker eyed him. “That’s three.”

“One’s for Horus.”

The baker’s face softened a fraction. He wrapped the loaves. November hesitated. “You got anything sweet?”

The baker grunted, reached under the counter, produced a small roll glazed with something brown and shiny. “One.”

“How much?”

The baker named a number that wasn’t fair. November glanced at the sweet, then at his coin pouch. He could still afford it. It would just make his week narrower. He handed the coins over.

“Don’t chew it all yourself,” the baker said.

November tucked the roll in with the loaves. “That’s her call.”

On the way back, he passed the Hall of the Fallen. The doors were open. A pair of healers were already inside, moving cots, checking lamps. Horus would be there in an hour, and if she was late someone would make a comment and she would ignore it. He paused in the doorway, just long enough to see a young man with a bandaged leg sitting up, grimacing as he shifted.

“You here for treatment?” one of the healers asked.

“No,” November said. He nodded toward the man. “He looks awake enough to eat.”

The healer glanced, then nodded. “We’ll bring him something.”

November left. He didn’t like the smell in there. It wasn’t fear. It wasn’t blood. It was the mix of both, the way it tried to cling to you. Horus never let it cling.

When he returned, Horus was tying her hair back. She took the bread, broke the sweet in half, handed him his piece like it was a negotiation she’d already won. They ate standing, too hungry to sit.

“Any trouble?” she asked.

“Wheel. Toma.”

“Ah.” She took another bite. “That man is going to owe you for the rest of his life.”

“He already owes me.”

She frowned. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

He shrugged. “He’s in a city. That’s enough.”

She chewed slowly, then swallowed. “You’re terrible at taking care of yourself.”

“I’m good at taking care of us.”

Her eyes softened. She reached up and brushed a crumb from his beard. “That’s true.”

They ate in a quiet that didn’t feel like emptiness. Just a lack of need. He loved that about her. There were days in his old life where silence meant no one was left. With her, it meant the opposite.

She gathered her bandages, slung her satchel. “I should go.”

“I’ll walk you.”

“You don’t need to.”

“I do.” He said it simply. He knew she could walk alone. That wasn’t the point.

They stepped into the street together. The morning had thickened. More smoke. More movement. The clang of a hammer on metal, the hiss of a forge, the bark of a command from a guard telling a pair of boys to clear the gate.

They walked toward the Hall. Horus moved with purpose, eyes scanning, shoulders set. November kept pace at her side.

“Did you sleep?” she asked.

“Five.”

“Good.” She smiled a little. “You can be useful today.”

“I’m always useful.”

“Sure.”

They reached the Hall and she stopped at the door. She looked at him, and there was a moment there, a sliver of something neither of them said. It wasn’t fear. It wasn’t dread. It was just the shape of the day waiting.

“Be back by sundown,” she said.

He nodded. “If the city doesn’t burn.”

Her mouth tightened at that. “Don’t say that.”

“It’s a city,” he said. “It always burns.”

She reached up and pulled his collar straight, a small, gentle thing. “Just come back.”

He leaned down and kissed her. Not long. Not hungry. Just enough.

Then she was inside, swallowed by the dim and the smell, and he was back in the street with his hands empty.

He didn’t have a job today. Not a formal one. He made himself one. He went to the docks and helped unload crates. He carried sacks for a butcher who was missing two fingers and all his patience. He fixed a loose hinge on the gate to a shop he’d never seen before. He did it because he could, because his hands had to be on something. He didn’t sit idle.

He took a break around midday, sitting on a low wall with a piece of bread. The city around him buzzed. The lower ring was alive. People were moving faster than usual. There was a thread of tightness in the air he didn’t want to name. He kept his eyes down, ate, drank.

A pair of children ran past, laughing, then stopped when a patrol moved through. The laughter died. The patrol didn’t look at them. They didn’t need to. The kids waited, then moved on. November watched them go and felt something knot in his chest, small and hard. He didn’t reach for it. He didn’t need to. It was there. It was supposed to be there.

He went to the Hall near afternoon and waited outside, leaning against the wall. Horus came out with another healer, their arms full of linens. She saw him, rolled her eyes.

“You’re stalking me,” she said.

“Keeping you safe.”

“From what?”

He gestured around them. “From all this.”

She huffed, then smiled. “We’re not in the outer ring, November.”

He looked past her toward the higher levels. The walls were visible there, black and distant. “We’re still in the city.”

She handed her linens to the other healer and stepped closer. “We’re safe.”

He didn’t answer. He didn’t need to. She knew he couldn’t promise something he didn’t control.

“You ate?” she asked.

“Yes.”

“Liar.”

He shrugged. “I ate enough.”

She touched his arm, light. “Come eat with me after shift.”

“Okay.”

“Okay, he says. That’s a good sign.”

He squeezed her hand. “I’ll be here.”

She went back in. He stayed outside, because he didn’t belong in there unless he had a reason. He watched the street. He listened to the city. He knew how to read it. The rhythm was off. It wasn’t panic. Not yet. It was the way people started to do little things twice. Check a latch. Look over their shoulder. Repeat a prayer they didn’t believe in. He knew because he’d done it. He felt it now in the way his hand drifted to his belt, where no sword hung.

He left when the sun had shifted and went toward the apartment. On the way, he stopped at the well again, filled the bucket. He carried it up, arms steady, and found the room empty. Horus was still at the Hall. He set the bucket down, pulled off his coat, and sat on the edge of the bed.

For a moment he didn’t do anything. He let his mind quiet. It was a skill he didn’t have to think about. He could feel the drop, the steadying, like a room settling after a door shuts. When nothing moved inside him, he could rest, even with his eyes open.

It didn’t last. A knock at the door. He stood, crossed, opened it. A young woman from two doors down, a mother, holding her boy.

“Sorry,” she said. “I— He fell. I don’t know—”

November looked at the boy’s arm. It was scraped, bleeding, the kind of wound a child forgets in a day. He took the cloth from her hand, wrapped it, tied it tight with a knot he’d learned on ships he’d never sailed.

“He’ll live,” he said.

She blinked. “Thank you.”

He nodded. She started to say more, then stopped. Sometimes thanks didn’t need to be a conversation. He closed the door.

He sat again. He thought about the old him in that narrow way he allowed. He didn’t spiral. He didn’t dwell. He measured. The old him would have slept until noon, then gone looking for drink. He would have laughed at the idea of water, of buckets, of bandages. He would have watched the day slide by and called it survival. The new him still knew how to survive. He just didn’t call it that anymore. He called it something else. He called it being someone Horus could look at and trust.

He stood. He couldn’t sit. He cleaned the table. He checked the door latch. He set aside a strip of cloth for Horus’s hands, the kind she preferred. When there was nothing left, he went back outside.

The city had shifted again. People were moving toward the inner rings, and not all of them were carrying goods. A group of militia marched past, helmets in hand, armor strapped but not worn. Someone shouted from a window. No one answered.

November’s pulse picked up. He didn’t run. He didn’t stand still. He moved toward the Hall.

He found Horus by the entrance, speaking with a guard. She saw him and stepped aside, waited until the guard moved on.

“What’s happening?” he asked.

She shook her head. “Orders. The garrison wants us ready.”

“For what?”

She shrugged. “For what they always want. For what they think is coming.”

He looked up toward the walls. It was the first time that day he let himself do it. Smoke curled along the line, not black, not yet. The air felt heavier. The city’s breath was no longer soft. It was holding.

“Come with me,” he said.

She glanced back at the Hall. “I can’t.”

“Then I’ll stay.”

“You’ll be in the way.”

“I can carry. Move. Do what you need.”

She hesitated. “Fine. But if I tell you to get out, you get out.”

“I always listen to you.”

She gave him a look. “No, you don’t.”

He shrugged. That was fair.

Inside, the Hall was full of motion. Healers moved between cots, checking supplies, tying bandages, shifting lamps. The air smelled of herbs and sweat. He took a place near the wall and waited for the first thing to do. It came quick. A man staggered in, a cut on his brow. Someone passed him a cloth. He pressed it, sat.

Horus moved through the room like she owned it. It wasn’t a question of command. It was the way everyone turned toward her when they needed something. She pointed, nodded, touched a shoulder here and there. November stayed out of her path.

He helped where he could. He fetched water, moved cots. He held a lamp while another healer stitched a gash. He didn’t get in the way. He didn’t try to fix things he couldn’t. He kept his hands moving.

The first horn sounded in the distance, a low, drawn note that rolled through the stone and made the room go still. It wasn’t a call for shift. It wasn’t the gate signal. It was deeper, older.

Everyone froze for half a breath. Then the Hall moved again, faster.

“Is that—” someone started.

Horus shook her head. “Keep working.”

November looked toward the door. He couldn’t see out, but he could feel the air change, the way it tightened around his chest. He walked to the entrance, peered out.

The street had stopped. People were looking up. The sound came again, a groan that didn’t belong to Emberfall. A second horn answered it, closer.

Horus appeared beside him. “Get inside,” she said.

“Just tell me—”

“No.” Her eyes were hard. “Inside.”

He hesitated. She didn’t.

He stepped back with her. The doors were closed. He could hear voices outside, raised, urgent. Then a sound like thunder rolled over the city. Not from the sky. From the ground. The hall shook. Dust fell from the ceiling.

A second impact followed, closer. The floor jolted under his boots. Somewhere a woman screamed. Horus was already moving, grabbing a stretcher, turning to a pair of healers.

“Prepare the front,” she said.

November’s stomach went cold. He moved to the entrance again. He shouldn’t have. He did.

The doors were open now, and he saw the street. Smoke, thick and dark, rising from the direction of the outer ring. People were running, not toward the Hall, but away from the walls. A man shouted something he couldn’t hear. The air felt like it had teeth.

Then the world broke.

The impact was so close it didn’t sound like anything. It was just force. The air punched him, the ground kicked him, the light went out and came back wrong. He hit the wall hard, felt the stone bite his shoulder. He didn’t know how long he was down. He didn’t know if there was sound. There was dust. There was grit in his mouth.

He pushed himself up. The hall was chaos. A section of the ceiling had dropped. Lamps were shattered. People were on the floor. Horus—he couldn’t see her. He wiped his eyes, staggered forward.

“Horus?”

No answer. He coughed. He moved through the debris, hands out, feeling for her. He saw a figure in a healer’s apron dragging a man with a broken leg. Not her. Another figure, head bleeding, trying to lift a child. Not her.

“Horus,” he said again, louder. The word tore his throat. He didn’t scream it. He couldn’t. It would have made it too real.

He found the spot where she’d been standing. It was gone, a heap of splintered wood and stone. He dug with his hands. His fingers went raw. He pulled a beam aside. He found bandages. He found a satchel ripped open. No Horus.

Someone grabbed his arm. “We need to move. It’s not safe.”

He shook them off. “Not yet.”

A second impact rolled through, further away this time, but enough to make the walls shiver. He coughed again, dust in his lungs.

“Horus!”

No answer.

He lifted another piece of rubble, then another. The room was filling with smoke. The door was a frame now, the street beyond a fog of gray and ash. He couldn’t see more than a few steps in any direction. People were shouting. The words didn’t land.

He stopped. He held still. He listened. He heard nothing of her.

He forced himself to stand. He turned, scanned the smoke, the bodies, the broken beams. He moved toward the street, toward the light. Maybe she’d gotten out. Maybe she was outside.

He stepped into the open, into a sky gone wrong. The smoke was thick, the air burning. He stumbled across broken stone, hands out. He called her name again, softer this time, like he could coax her out of the fog. Nothing.

There was no melodrama in him. There wasn’t room. There was only the fact of not seeing her. The fact of not hearing her. The world narrowed to that.

The horns kept sounding. The impacts kept coming. Emberfall was being hit, and he was standing in the middle of it with his hands empty.

He looked back at the Hall, then out into the smoke, and he had no idea where to go. He took one step, then another. People rushed past him, voices frantic, but he didn’t catch them.

Silence filled his head. Smoke filled the air.
