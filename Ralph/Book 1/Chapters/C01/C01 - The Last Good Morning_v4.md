The morning came the way it always did for November Falls — not with a bell or a knock, just the sense that he’d had enough. He opened his eyes to the thin gray light, to the slow breath beside him, to the room that still smelled faintly of smoke even after he’d scrubbed the walls. Emberfall never really let go of the forge air. It lived in the stone.

He lay there a moment because the quiet was the best part. No shouting in the street. No iron screaming. No horns. Just the distant, usual grind of a waking city and the warmth at his back.

Horus was on her side, facing him, one arm flung over the blanket, her hair a dark spill across the pillow. She slept like she meant it, mouth a little open, brow smooth. When she breathed out, the hair at her temple lifted and fell. He watched it for a minute and let himself be still.

He could get up now and start the day before the day started him. He could lie there and pretend he was someone else, somewhere else. He chose the first. It was always the first.

He eased a leg out, careful not to shift the mattress. The floor was cold. He didn’t like it; he loved it. It made him alert. A reminder. He pulled on his trousers and the worn shirt on the peg.

Horus made a small sound, almost a sigh, then her hand found the empty space where he’d been. She did not wake.

In the corner, his sword leaned against the wall. Borrowed. It was still not a part of him. He didn’t touch it.

He crossed to the basin, poured a little water from the jug into his hands, and washed his face. The water was cold enough to make him hiss. He let the hiss be the only sound he made.

He left the room quietly, stepping around the loose board that still creaked. He knew every sound in this place. It was small, but it was his. Their place. He could name the scratches on the table and tell you where they came from without looking.

In the hallway, two children were asleep on the steps — brothers from the next room, knees drawn up to their chests. Their mother worked the night shift at the ovens, and November had told her she could leave them here if she needed. He moved past them and down the stairs, hand on the wall, no creak this time.

The street outside was damp with last night’s mist. The air had a bite. The sky was a washed-out steel, the sun still a rumor behind the smoke.

He stood on the stoop for a breath and let his mind go quiet. It was easy. It always was. The world pulled away, the noise softened, and there was only the morning and the shape of the work he’d set for himself.

When he opened his eyes, he went right into it.

The water barrel by the corner was half empty. He’d filled it two days ago, and the neighborhood had been using it. It wasn’t his barrel, really. It was a splintered thing he’d dragged from a burned cart and scrubbed clean, but people used it because it was there.

He walked the three blocks to the pump near the old tanner’s yard. A woman in a shawl was already there with a clay jug, arms shaking with the weight of it. He took it from her without asking, set it under the spout, and pumped. The handle squealed in protest, then gave. Water bled out.

She watched him and didn’t argue. She just stepped back and let him work.

When the jug was full, he set it back in her hands and nodded. She nodded back, no thanks spoken because none was needed. There were a hundred small arrangements like that in this city. You took what was offered when you needed, you offered when you could. It was the only thing that kept the lower rings from splintering entirely.

He filled two buckets for the barrel, then carried them back with a steady pace. His shoulders were thick from carrying water. He didn’t mind. It gave him something to do.

On the way back, a cart wheel had slipped into a rut, and two older men were straining against the axle. One of them looked ready to give up.

November put the buckets down, lifted the corner of the cart with both hands, and held it while the men righted the wheel. No one said anything. They didn’t need to. He picked the buckets back up and kept moving.

By the time he returned, the children on the steps had woken. They watched him pour water into the barrel and then asked if there was more. He filled two tin cups and handed them over. They scurried off like they were getting away with something.

He liked that he could do that. It felt small. It was small. But it was real.

Back inside, he made a pot of boiled barley with the last of the dried apples. The smell brought Horus down the stairs, hair still loose, bare feet on the wood. She pulled his shirt on over herself and stopped at the table.

“You’re spoiling me,” she said, voice still thick with sleep.

He set two bowls down. “If you call barley and old apples spoiling, you’re doing it wrong.”

She sat and looked at him over the rim of the bowl. “I was trying to be nice.”

“Try harder.”

She snorted, then took a bite. He ate without hurry. Eating used to be a gulped thing, the kind you did when you remembered you hadn’t. Now it was a ritual. It mattered because everything he did now mattered.

Horus watched him between bites, as if checking that he was there, that he was the same man who had gone to bed beside her. She did that sometimes. He knew why. He understood it without needing to ask.

“You slept,” she said. It wasn’t a question.

“Five hours.”

“On purpose?”

He looked at her. “On purpose.”

She nodded. “Good.”

He had learned to treat sleep like a tool. Not a luxury. Not an escape. He had spent years letting the bottle decide what his body did. Now he decided. That was all. That was everything.

She reached across the table and flicked his wrist with a finger. “You’re still bleeding.”

He looked down. A scrape on his knuckle had reopened where he’d lifted the cart. He hadn’t felt it. He never did, not until later. He flexed his hand.

“I’ll live.”

She pointed with her spoon. “You’re supposed to be the example.”

He lifted his hand. “I’m not the example. I’m the warning.”

She smiled, then, the quick kind that reached her eyes. It was a small thing, but it warmed the room.

They ate in quiet for a few minutes. The neighborhood was coming alive outside — footsteps, a distant cart, a dog barking once and then stopping when it was called back. A hammer rang once from somewhere a block or two away, then stopped. The city had a pulse. It was rough, uneven, but it was there.

“You going to the Hall today?” he asked.

“Half shift,” she said. “They’re rotating us now. Fewer wounded coming in this week.”

“Lucky us.”

She glanced toward the window. “They say the outer camps are full. The militia’s been doubling shifts at the wall.”

He didn’t answer right away. It wasn’t fear that kept him quiet. It was the way that kind of talk could swallow a morning whole if you let it. Rumors had teeth in Emberfall.

“I’ll walk you there,” he said.

She tipped her head. “You don’t need to.”

“I want to.”

“I know.” She leaned back and let her foot bump his under the table. “Just… don’t stare at the wounded like you’re counting your future scars.”

He raised a brow. “You know me too well.”

“Someone has to.” She gave him a look, then softened. “November.”

“Yeah?”

“Promise me you won’t go looking for trouble today.”

He didn’t like promises. He kept them. That was the problem. He considered it and then said, “I’ll walk you to the Hall. I’ll come back here. I’ll keep my head down.”

She let it sit. “That’s not a promise.”

“It’s the truth.” He meant it.

She considered him the way she always did — not testing, just reading. Then she nodded, the matter closed.

He cleaned the bowls. He tightened the laces on his boots. He checked the bolt on the door, out of habit more than need. Emberfall’s lower rings weren’t kind, but they were his. He knew which faces belonged, which didn’t. He had made himself part of the fabric, whether he meant to or not.

They stepped out together. The light had brightened, but the sun was still a muted disk behind the smoke. The street was busier now, people moving with baskets and tools, children weaving around knees. A man with a barrow of charcoal rolled past and gave Horus a curt nod. She returned it. She knew almost everyone on this block. When you stitched people back together, they remembered you.

Horus tucked her arm through his. It was casual, not clinging. He liked that about her. She didn’t need his strength to hold her up. She chose to take it anyway.

He kept his eyes moving as they walked. It was a habit he couldn’t shake, and he didn’t want to. He took in corners, alleys, the rhythm of the crowd. He watched for shifts, not threats. The city told you when it was about to change, if you knew how to listen.

At the corner near the tanner’s yard, a boy no more than ten tried to drag a sack twice his size. November stopped, took the sack, and lifted it onto the boy’s shoulder. The boy tried to protest. November shook his head once, and the boy fell quiet.

“He’s going to think you’re magic,” Horus said as they walked on.

“Hope not,” November said. “Magic gets you burned.”

She nudged him with her elbow. “Still not wrong.”

The Hall of the Fallen sat on a rise, stone blackened by soot and time. The carved arch over the entrance was worn smooth by years of hands. People moved in and out steadily, though not in the flood of earlier months. The war had ebbed. For now.

As they approached, a pair of legionnaires were coming down the steps carrying a man on a litter. His eyes were open, but glassy, jaw clenched tight against pain. Horus’s hand tightened on November’s arm as she slipped free to go to him, and for a moment he watched her move with that calm, focused speed that had pulled him out of a gutter.

She held the man’s head still, spoke low, and signaled for two apprentices to take the litter inside. The man’s eyes tracked her, then closed.

When she turned back to November, her face was composed but pale. “See? No trouble.”

He nodded. “I’m not looking.”

She stepped close and smoothed his collar. It was a small intimacy, but it landed. She knew how to steady him, how to pull him back into the quiet when the city tried to pull him apart.

“Be here when I get off,” she said.

“I will.”

She hesitated like there was something else. There always was. Then she leaned up, kissed him once, short and firm, and stepped away.

He watched her go inside. He did not follow. He stood on the steps for a beat, hands on the worn stone, and let his mind go quiet again. He could feel the pull to linger, to find something to do inside, to be near her. He didn’t. He had promised the truth. He would keep it.

He turned back toward the street.

The walk home was faster without her. His stride lengthened. He knew these streets by feel, the way his feet landed on the uneven stones. The day was brighter now. There were more faces, more noise. A cart rumbled past carrying black iron ingots toward the upper ring. A line of women waited at a grain shop that hadn’t been full in weeks.

He passed a group of militia recruits running drills in an open lot, their movements clumsy and out of sync. The trainer barked at them until his voice went rough. November watched them for a moment, not with contempt, not with envy. It was just information. They would be the wall if the wall fell. He hoped they would never have to be.

A small boy shoved another in the dirt. The other boy shoved back. They squared up.

November walked over, put a hand on each shoulder, and separated them. Neither fought him. He didn’t say a word, just looked at them until the first boy looked down, then both. He let go, and they walked away in opposite directions.

He didn’t think about it afterward. It wasn’t a moment. It was just what he did.

By the time he reached his building, the sun had climbed a finger higher behind the smoke. He went upstairs, stepped into the room, and closed the door. The quiet was different without Horus. It was still good, but thinner.

He considered sitting. He didn’t. He lifted the sword from the corner and carried it to the small patch of open space between the bed and the table. He set it down, not drawn. He had no teacher, only habits and the memory of watching others.

He went through his motions. Slow. The grip was wrong. The footwork was wrong. He knew it was wrong. He corrected what he could. The rest would take time.

When he finished, he sat on the edge of the bed and wiped sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. His breathing was steady. That was the point.

He could feel the pull at the edge of him — the old anger, the old urge to push until he broke just to see if he could. It was the thing behind his ribs that sometimes woke him up in the dark and told him to go to the bars, to find trouble, to feel something sharp.

He let it sit there. He didn’t pretend it wasn’t there. He didn’t feed it. He watched it, and in a few breaths, it went quiet.

He stood and poured water into the basin, then splashed his face. He was not the man who had woken in the Hall of the Fallen with a broken nose and no reason to stop drinking. He was not that man because he had decided not to be. That was all. There was no revelation, no miracle. Just choice, repeated until it stuck.

He took a clean cloth and wrapped the scrape on his knuckle. It was small, but it mattered. The world took what you gave it.

He sat and waited.

He did not fidget. He did not pace. He let his mind go still and watched the slow drift of light across the floor. It was a kind of discipline, and it was the one he was best at.

Time passed. The city moved around him. Somewhere far off, a bell rang once. He did not know why. He did not need to.

A shout rose from the street below. He heard the scrape of boots on stone as someone ran. Then another. The voices were not panicked. Not yet. It was just a wave of movement, the way a city shifts when something changes at the edges.

He went to the window and looked out.

People were pausing in the street, turning their heads toward the upper ring. The forge smoke was thicker there, and it always was, but there was a difference now. A smear of darker color, low and heavy.

He watched it for a heartbeat, then backed away. He was not going to stand at a window like a child. If something was coming, he would hear it.

He did.

It started low, a long moan that lifted the hair on his arms, then rose into a full-throated horn that seemed to run along the stone itself. It was not a bell. It was not a warning shout. It was something older and bigger.

The siege siren.

He had heard it in drills. He had heard it in stories. He had never heard it like this, in the middle of a normal morning with barley still in his mouth and Horus in the Hall.

His body moved before his mind caught up. He crossed the room in two steps, grabbed his shirt, and shrugged into it. He took the sword and belted it on with hands that did not shake.

He was at the door when the first impact hit.

It wasn’t close. It was a distant thump that you felt more than heard, a tremor through the floorboards, the glass in the window ticking in its frame. Then another, closer, sharper. Dust fell from the ceiling.

The horn sounded again, and this time it split, a second note joining it — higher, harsher. The sound stabbed down the street.

He opened the door and ran.

The stairwell was full of people, some in boots, some barefoot, all moving in the same direction. He pushed through, shoulder to shoulder, and hit the street.

The air had changed. There was a metallic tang, like burned oil. The smoke over the upper ring had thickened into a column, dark and roiling.

A second impact landed, and this one was close enough to feel in his teeth. A woman screamed. A child cried. November didn’t stop. He moved against the flow, cutting through toward the Hall.

The street was chaos now — not full panic, but the beginning of it. People moved in jagged lines. A cart had tipped, spilling sacks of grain into the road as its driver tried to turn back. The horn kept sounding, relentless.

He ran, and the city seemed to run with him.

The third impact came with a flash.

It hit somewhere near the Hall. The light was brief, a sharp white that turned the world flat. Then the sound followed, the deep crack of stone breaking and something else, a roar that rolled over the roofs.

The wave hit him like a shove. He stumbled but kept his feet. Dust rolled down the street in a wall, chased by a rush of hot air that sucked the breath from his lungs.

He reached the steps of the Hall as people were pouring out. Some were coughing, some bleeding, some carrying others. He pushed past them, calling her name once, not loud, not a scream. Just a name.

Inside, it was dim and full of smoke. The main hall had been a place of order. Now it was a mess of toppled cots and scattered instruments. The air was thick, and every breath burned.

He moved through it, eyes stinging, and shouted her name again. Louder this time. It came back to him in broken echoes.

A groan came from under a fallen beam. He lifted it with both hands and shoved it aside. A young apprentice rolled free, face gray with dust. She blinked up at him, dazed. He pulled her to her feet and steered her toward the exit. She stumbled away.

He went deeper, toward the back where the healers’ rooms were. The corridor was partially collapsed. A section of ceiling had come down, blocking the way.

“November.”

He turned. It was a man he recognized, one of the orderlies, blood on his forehead.

“Where is she?”

The man shook his head. “She was in the ward. They moved the worst of them to the east wing when the horn sounded. Then—” He gestured helplessly toward the rubble.

“East wing,” November repeated, as if saying it would make it true.

He went left, down a side passage that stank of smoke and burned linen. The floor here had cracked, a jagged seam running down the center. He jumped it and kept going.

Another impact landed, somewhere closer, and the wall to his right shuddered. Dust poured down the corridor. He coughed, eyes watering. He didn’t stop.

He reached the east wing and found it half gone. The outer wall had been torn away, exposing the ward to open air and the gray sky beyond. Beds were scattered, sheets fluttering in the gusts. A body lay still near the threshold, a healer in a white apron, face down.

He moved past her, scanning, chest tight. “Horus.”

No answer.

He walked through the wreckage, picking his way over broken stone. He found a set of overturned cots, a spilled tray of instruments, a lamp lying on its side with its flame still burning against the floor. He kicked it out.

“Horus.” His voice was hoarse now. He forced it to stay even.

Another horn sounded, closer, and the sound of it shivered through the exposed room. Outside, beyond the broken wall, smoke boiled up from the lower ring. Something was burning.

He saw a length of white cloth caught on a splintered beam. He grabbed it, thinking it might be hers, and held it for a moment. It was not. It was just a strip of sheet.

A beam groaned overhead. He stepped back as it sagged, then slammed down, splitting the floor. He caught himself on the edge of a bed frame and steadied his breath.

He called her name one more time. It went into the smoke and did not come back.

He moved toward the exit, not because he was done, but because the building was coming apart. He would not help anyone if he died under it. He knew that. He hated that.

He dragged another person from the rubble on his way out, a man with a shattered leg, breath coming in wet gasps. November hooked him under the arms and pulled him into the open air. The man clutched at his sleeve.

“Help,” the man said. It was barely a word.

“I am,” November said, and he meant it.

He got the man to the steps and set him down with a pair of apprentices who were already working on the wounded. He turned back toward the Hall, but the way was blocked now. The entrance had partially collapsed, the stone arch cracked and sagging.

The smoke thickened. Ash drifted down like a slow, gray snow.

He stood there in the street with his hand on the hilt of a sword he had never wanted to use. He looked at the broken Hall. He looked at the people moving, the blood, the dust, the wide eyes.

He looked for Horus and did not see her.

The horn sounded again, and this time it was joined by a deeper sound, a thunder that rolled across the upper ring. Another strike. Another breath of heat.

The world narrowed to what was in front of him. Rubble. Smoke. People with blood on their hands. The ordinary morning burned away.

He took one step, then another, into the street, not toward the Hall, not away from it, but into the gray where the city was breaking.

Silence and smoke.
