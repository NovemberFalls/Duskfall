Before I draft, I need a couple specifics so I don’t break your continuity rules:

1. Which chapter is `C01` (title, POV, and day)?  
2. Where should I save it (exact filename/path under `C:\Users\lenbo\Dropbox\_DND_Duskfall\Duskfall\Ralph\Book 1`), or do you want it pasted here?  
3. Any must-hit beats or scene anchors for C01 beyond what’s in the premise?

C01 must be:

Title: The Last Good Morning
Primary POV: November Falls
Secondary POV: None
Day: Day 1 — Before the siege strike

Purpose:

Establish November and Horus together

Establish sobriety and rebuilding

Show the Creed in lived behavior, not speech

Establish emotional normalcy before rupture

End with the first goblin siege blast

Stoneveil does NOT appear.
Thokk does NOT appear.
No tactical overview.

This chapter belongs to November.

The siege is Stoneveil’s story.

The opening is November’s.

Ralph/Book 1/Chapters/C01/draft.md

C01 must include:

Scene Anchors

Morning quiet in Emberfall

November waking naturally (sleep discipline)

Horus present — warmth, sarcasm, grounding

A subtle hint of his shadow (internal restraint, not dramatized)

Small act of selflessness (water, helping someone, small kindness)

November reflecting briefly on who he was vs who he is

No exposition dump

No war speech

No destiny language

The Break

Siege siren / horn

First distant impact

Goblin artillery strike

Disorientation

Rubble

Horus gone

No melodrama

No screaming speech

No dramatic vow

End with:

Silence and smoke.
