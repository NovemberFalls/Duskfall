The Hall of the Fallen had always smelled like iron and vinegar. Today it smelled like iron and smoke. The smoke clung to the stone as if it had found a seam and decided to stay.

Kael Veyne stood at the threshold and waited for the next body.

He did not move until the door burst open. Two men in soot-black armor carried a third between them. The third’s mouth worked without sound, jaw loose, eyes glassy. His chest rose in shallow, wet pulls. Blood slicked the men’s forearms. It ran down to their wrists and dripped onto the flagstones in slow, steady drops.

Kael stepped aside, then back in. He touched two fingers to the soldier’s brow. “By the Measure,” he said, the words smooth and practiced. “By the Scale. Be counted.”

The man’s eyes darted at the voice. They did not focus. His lips shaped a word that did not come out.

“West table,” Kael said to the bearers. “Cold cloth. Magister Rell is there.”

They nodded and hurried on.

The hall was full. Not of voices. Of bodies. The cots were packed in rows that used to be pews. The floor between them held the overflow. Some men lay on blankets. Some lay on their cloaks. A few lay on bare stone because there was nowhere else to put them.

He moved down the line, the rhythm of his work a cadence he had spoken a thousand times. It mattered that the words were correct. It mattered that the posture was correct. He had believed that was enough.

A woman sat upright with a bandage across her cheek. She watched him approach with the flat, animal stare of someone whose pain had become a background hum. Her fingers were pressed to a soaked dressing at her side.

“Your name,” he said.

“Ana,” she said. Her voice was too small for the room.

“By the Measure, Ana,” he said, and placed his hand on her shoulder. He felt the tremor in her bones. “By the Scale. Be counted.”

She closed her eyes as if waiting for something to happen. Nothing did. The tremor did not stop. The blood under her fingers did not slow.

He moved on.

The air shuddered with the distant beat of war-horns. The sound reached the Hall as a low, grinding moan. It was not close. It was never close enough to stop here.

He took a step, then another. The flow of bodies did not stop. Two boys carried a man who had no legs below the knee. Another was dragged by a friend who could not lift him. A priest of lesser rank leaned against a wall, his sleeves rolled to the elbow, hands red to the forearm.

“Kael,” the priest said. “We’re out of clean cloth.”

“Cut the torn banners,” Kael said. “Boil them if you can. If you cannot, use them anyway.”

The priest nodded and went.

He passed the altar. The candles were shorter than they should have been this early in the day. Someone had been relighting them with hands that shook.

At the far end of the hall, the triage line had been marked in chalk. White for urgent. Blue for salvageable. Black for gone. There were more black marks than there should have been.

Kael looked at the line once, as he always did, and then made himself look away. It was not his decision. It had never been his decision. He was here to bear witness and to serve. He had told himself that. He had told others that. He held to it because it was the only seam that had not yet torn.

A man with a crushed forearm reached for him. “Inquisitor,” he rasped.

Kael knelt. The man’s fingers were the color of ash. He was trying to move his hand, and the effort made his face whiten.

“By the Measure,” Kael said. The words came out right. The cadence did not break. “By the Scale.”

The man’s eyes closed. He exhaled. It was not relief. It was surrender.

Kael held his hand until the breath stopped.

He stood. A fresh wave of bodies came in.

—

By mid-day, the hall was no longer a room. It was a machine. The door opened, the wounded came in, the triage marks were assigned, the rites were said, and the dead were pulled to the back like sacks of grain.

The sound of fighting reached them in bursts. When the wind shifted, the smoke thinned and the light changed, and the shadows of the High Cathedral’s stained glass threw red bars across the faces of the wounded. It looked like chains.

Kael walked the rows. He was the calm in a room that had no space for it. That was his role. That was what he had spent twenty years building.

At the north corner, a boy of fifteen sat upright, eyes white with shock. A single arrow stood upright from his thigh, the shaft trembling with each shallow breath.

“I need you to hold still,” Kael said.

The boy’s lips moved. Nothing came out.

Kael placed his hand on the boy’s head. He began the Rite of Binding. It was a short rite. It did not promise healing. It did not even promise relief. It promised only that the boy’s name would be spoken by someone who would remember it.

“By the Measure,” Kael said, and his voice was steady. “By the Scale. Be counted.”

“Does it work?” the boy said. The question came out in one breath, a single line, the way a man speaks when he has no air to spare.

Kael did not look away. “It counts you,” he said. “It does not bargain.”

The boy nodded as if that was enough, though nothing in his face said it was.

A healer pulled the arrow. The boy screamed. The scream went up, broke, fell. It was lost in the larger noise.

Kael moved on.

He did not pray for miracles. He prayed for order. He prayed that his hands would not shake. He prayed that the words would not fail him. He prayed that if he could not save them, at least he would not add to their fear.

By late afternoon, his voice began to roughen. He did not stop.

—

The corridor outside the Hall of the Fallen was lined with the unclaimed. Men who could not be triaged yet, or could not be moved, or who had been brought to the Hall only to die at the threshold. Kael stepped between them, his boots leaving damp prints on the stones.

He passed two Inquisitorial adepts carrying crates of salves. “We need more,” he said.

“There is no more,” one of them said. It was not defiance. It was a statement of fact. “The stores were used at the wall.”

“The stores were at the wall yesterday,” Kael said.

He did not mean it as a rebuke. It came out that way. The adept did not look at him. He kept walking.

The corridor opened into the central nave. The Cathedral was dim. The higher windows were greyed out with ash. The great statue of Tyr stood with his arms extended, his bronze scales hanging empty. Kael looked up at it as he passed.

He had been taught that the statue was a symbol, not a conduit. That faith did not require objects. That the gods did not live in metal.

He had believed that. It had never mattered before.

He stopped at the base of the statue and bowed his head for a count of three. He did not ask for anything. He did not know what to ask. He moved on.

—

At dusk, he went to the wall.

He did not need to. It did not help the Hall. But he needed to see the line. To put faces to the names coming through his hands. To remind himself that the city still held.

The climb was long. The stairs wound through narrow passages that smelled of damp stone and old soot. He emerged into the open and the sound hit him like a fist. The day’s assault had burned out, but the wall still hummed with the aftershock of it. Men were slumped behind merlons, armor loose, water skins hanging. Some slept. Some stared out over the black fields beyond the gate.

He walked along the parapet, careful not to interrupt work. There were fewer men than there should have been.

A corporal leaned on his spear and nodded to him. “Inquisitor.”

“Report,” Kael said.

“Quiet now,” the corporal said. “They’ll hit again after nightfall. They always do.”

Kael nodded. “They always do.”

He moved on.

The smoke was thinner up here. He could see the churned earth where the enemy camp sat, a sea of low fires like coals. Shapes moved around them. He could not make them out. It did not matter. The wall was between them. For now.

He stopped at a break in the line where the men were shifted into fresh positions. The new faces were young. Too young. One of them was Edric Thane.

Edric stood three paces back from the wall, helmet tucked under his arm. His hair was damp with sweat. There was a line of grime across his cheek that made him look older than he was. He was talking to a sergeant, nodding, his jaw set. He looked like a soldier.

Kael felt the old pull in his gut. He knew the angle of the wall, the range of the enemy, the odds of a breach. He could see the bodies in his mind before the horns sounded. He could see Edric among them.

He stepped forward before he meant to. His hand tightened around the leather strap of his own satchel.

“Edric,” he said.

The boy turned. Relief hit his face, then was tamped down. He straightened. “Uncle.”

Kael did not touch him. He had not touched him since the siege began. It would have meant too much, to both of them.

“How is the Hall?” Edric asked.

“Full,” Kael said.

Edric’s eyes flicked toward the parapet, toward the dark beyond. He had learned not to ask more. “We’re holding.”

“Keep your head down,” Kael said. It was what he said to every soldier. It sounded thin in his mouth.

Edric nodded. “Yes, sir.”

Kael opened his mouth to tell him to come off the wall. He did not. There were too many ears. There were too many rules. He had written half of those rules. He had enforced them for years. He had pulled men from duty for less.

He had pulled strings to get Edric here because he had believed proximity to the Warden would make him safe. It had been a clean, simple belief. It had not cost him until now.

Edric put his helmet on and turned away. The sergeant called for the line to shift, and the boy moved with the others, disappearing into the press.

Kael stood there until he could no longer see him.

He thought, for the first time in years, a raw, simple thing: I want him off this wall.

He did not speak it. He could not say it aloud without breaking something that had held him up since he was sixteen.

He turned back to the stairs and went down.

—

Night came with the horn. The hall filled again. The cadence of the rites broke once when his voice caught on a name. He did not know why.

A man staggered in with his arm wrapped in a bloody cloth. “They breached the south spur,” he said, and then collapsed.

Kael did not look to the door. He stayed with the man in front of him. He said the words. He placed the hand. He counted him.

The triage line moved. Two healers argued with a captain over a man with a crushed chest. The captain wanted him moved to the black. The healers wanted more time.

A new voice cut through the air. “White mark. West table.”

Kael looked up. Warden Stoneveil had come in without announcement. He moved through the hall like a measured stride through mud: efficient, heavy, unyielding. His armor was stained. His face was not.

The healers shifted aside. The captain stepped back. Stoneveil did not look at them. He looked at the man on the floor.

“He won’t make it,” a healer said. “We can try.”

Stoneveil shook his head once. “No. Move the next three to white. This one goes black.”

The healer swallowed. “Warden—”

“White,” Stoneveil said. “Now.”

The healer moved. The captain moved. The man on the floor did not.

Kael watched and felt something tighten inside him. The decision was clean. The numbers were clear. It was the right call. It was the call he would have made.

That did not help.

Stoneveil’s gaze flicked once to Kael. There was no apology in it. There was no request. Only acknowledgement of another man who understood what had just happened.

Kael nodded. He did not trust his voice.

The Warden moved on. He placed a hand on a soldier’s shoulder, said a quiet word Kael could not hear, and left as swiftly as he had come. He did not stay for thanks. He did not look back.

Kael watched him go.

The hall kept moving.

—

Sometime after midnight, Kael’s prayers began to fray.

It was not loud. There was no crack, no clear point where the break happened. It was in the small spaces between the words. The pauses were longer. The cadence went uneven. The syllables did not align with the rhythm he had drilled into himself.

He tried to fix it. He straightened his back. He enunciated. He counted his breaths. It did not return.

He bent over a boy whose gut had been opened. The boy’s eyes were wild. His hands clawed at Kael’s sleeves.

“Stay with me,” Kael said, and then stopped, because that was not the rite. It was a command, and he had no right to give it.

He placed his hand on the boy’s forehead. He began again.

“By the Measure,” he said.

The boy’s eyes found his. There was a moment of clarity there, a brief, fierce grasp. Then it slipped.

“By the Scale,” Kael said. The words felt hollow. He said them anyway.

Another man brought in a soldier with a mangled knee. The soldier was awake and swearing. Kael held his jaw until the healer could set the bone. He said the rite as the bone slid into place and the man screamed, the words coming out of him between sobs.

He was not sure he had said them in the right order. He was not sure it mattered.

He moved on. He kept moving. He did not stop because there was no place to stop.

—

In the early hours before dawn, the hall thinned. The wounded were fewer, or the carriers were slower. Kael sat on a low stool by the wall and closed his eyes for the space of three breaths.

He saw Edric’s face in the dark. He saw Stoneveil’s hand pointing toward the black mark. He saw the boy with the arrow. He saw the statue’s empty scales.

He opened his eyes.

There was a man lying alone at the far end of the hall, beyond the last cot. His breath was shallow. No one stood over him. Kael went to him.

The man’s face was half burned, the skin cracked and red. His eyes were open. He looked at Kael and seemed not to see him.

Kael knelt. The stone was cold through his trousers.

He placed his hand on the man’s brow. “By the Measure,” he said, and his voice broke on the first word. It was a small break. It was enough.

He closed his eyes and tried again.

“By the Measure,” he said.

The man’s breathing slowed. Kael felt it under his palm.

“By the Scale,” he said, and the words came out uneven, the cadence a stagger. He tried to catch it, to pull it back into the rhythm he knew.

“Be counted,” he said.

He waited. The man exhaled and did not inhale.

Kael sat there a moment longer than he should have. His hand did not move.

He stood and made his way back toward the altar. The candles had burned low. The wax had pooled in thick rings around their bases.

He knelt before the altar. He folded his hands. He began the prayer of endurance, the one he had spoken since his first day in the Path.

“By the Measure,” he whispered. “By the—”

The words snagged. He tried again.

“By the Measure,” he said. “By the…”

He stopped. His mouth moved without sound.

He closed his eyes and bowed his head.

“By the…” he said, and the prayer broke mid-sentence.
