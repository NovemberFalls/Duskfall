Before I draft C05, I need two quick clarifications to stay aligned with your canon and pacing.

1. What is the exact POV and scene scope for C05 (who, where, and which day/hour)?
2. Any specific beats you want included or avoided in this chapter?

POV, Scope, Timeline

Title: The Grind
Primary POV: Inquisitor Adept Kael Veyne
Secondary POV: None
Day: Day 3 — Midday to night
Timeframe: Sustained siege grind

Location:

Hall of the Fallen

Cathedral corridor

Wounded triage

Brief wall observation

2️⃣ Must-Hit Beats
Required

Kael administering rites

Wounded flooding in

Prayers unanswered

Faith cracks in syntax (not speech)

Edric visible on wall from distance

Kael wrestling with pulling him off line — but doesn’t

Stoneveil’s triage decision witnessed (cold calculus)

Kael realizing faith and survival may conflict

This is the “Faith vs Function” chapter.

Avoid

No overt god commentary

No confirmed divine silence

No cosmic explanation

No sermon

No melodramatic collapse

End with:
Kael’s prayer breaking mid-sentence.
