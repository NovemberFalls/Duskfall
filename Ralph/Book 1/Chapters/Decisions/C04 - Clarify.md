Before I draft C04, I need two quick clarifications to stay aligned with your canon and pacing.

1. What is the exact POV and scene scope for C04 (who, where, and which day/hour)?
2. Any specific beats you want included or avoided in this chapter?

POV, Scope, Timeline

Title: First Blood
Primary POV: November Falls
Secondary POV: Minimal environmental soldier presence
Day: Day 2 — Early morning to midmorning
Timeframe: November volunteers for defense

Location:

Inner wall staging area

Armory line

Wall position

First combat engagement

2️⃣ Must-Hit Beats
Required

November chooses to volunteer (not conscripted yet)

Composite unit assignment

Edric introduced (make reader care)

First close combat

November performs poorly but refuses to leave

He takes a hit

He gets back up

He helps someone else before himself

His Creed surfaces internally, not spoken aloud

This is where readers begin respecting him.

Not because he wins.

Because he stays.

Avoid

No clean victories

No epic speech

No myth framing

No sudden skill spike

No Blackout event yet

No leadership declaration

End with:
November exhausted, blood on his teeth, still standing.
