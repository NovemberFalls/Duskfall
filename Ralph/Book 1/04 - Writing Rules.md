## Writing Rules and Style Guide

## THE VOICE

### General Prose Style
- **Grimdark, not nihilist.** Everything matters too much. The cost is always too high. But it matters.
- **Visceral and grounded.** We are in the dirt. We smell the blood. We feel the weight of the armor. Abstraction is the enemy of impact.
- **Sparse in combat, heavy in silence.** Short sentences when swords clash. Longer, weighted passages in the quiet between. The rhythm of prose mirrors the rhythm of siege.
- **No omniscient narrator.** Tight third-person, locked to the POV character. The reader knows only what the character knows, sees only what they see, and misses what they miss.

### POV-Specific Rules

**Stoneveil:** Military precision. Controlled. Sentences are disciplined. He thinks in tactical terms -- angles, numbers, positioning. The cracks show in what he *doesn't* think about. When memory intrudes (the Anvil, the fire), it arrives uninvited and is pushed away. His sections should feel like a man holding himself together through sheer force of will.

**November Falls:** Honest and internal. He talks to himself -- the inner compass. His narration is raw but not chaotic. He is a man who has learned to think clearly under pressure because the alternative is the bottle. He notices things others miss (the resourceful thinker) but his combat descriptions should be clumsy -- he doesn't have the vocabulary of a trained warrior. He describes fighting the way a civilian would: messy, confusing, terrifying.

**Thokk Ironhide:** Blunt. Declarative. Short, muscular sentences. The orcish voice from the military docs -- but turned inward. Beneath the simplicity is a leader who sees clearly and grieves privately. His sections should surprise the reader with depth. He is not articulate. He is *honest*.

**Kael Veyne:** Formal. Liturgical. Structured like prayer -- petition, confession, absolution. As the siege progresses, the structure breaks. Prayers become fragmented. Confessions become questions. The prose style itself should deteriorate as his faith cracks.

## COMBAT RULES

1. **Every fight has a cost.** No one walks away from combat unscathed. If November fights, he bleeds. If Stoneveil fights, he tires. If Thokk fights, warriors die. There are no free wins.

2. **Describe the ugly.** The sounds. The smells. The way a blade catches on bone. The way a dying man sounds different from a wounded one. Combat is not spectacle. It is butchery with a purpose.

3. **November is outclassed.** Always. He survives through stubbornness and luck, not skill. His combat should read like a man drowning who refuses to stop swimming. The trained soldiers beside him are faster, cleaner, more efficient. November is *present*.

4. **Thokk is a force.** When Thokk fights, it should be devastating. He is what November is not -- a warrior born and forged. The contrast matters. The reader should feel the difference between a man who fights to survive and a man who was built for war.

5. **No battle porn.** If a fight scene exists, it advances character or story. A fight that only shows combat is a fight that shouldn't be in the book.

## WORLD-BUILDING RULES

1. **Show, never tell.** The reader learns about the Veilfire War through scars on the walls, not through exposition. They learn about orc culture through Thokk's actions, not through a history lesson.

2. **Earn every detail.** If a piece of world-building appears, it must serve the scene. The Sundered Gate's rune-wards are mentioned because they're failing under the siege, not because they're interesting lore.

3. **Trust the reader.** Don't explain the military hierarchy. Show it through how characters interact. Don't explain the gods' departure. Show it through unanswered prayers.

4. **Bloodhollow is a character.** The world is hostile, exhausted, and dying. Weather, terrain, and environment should press on the characters the way the siege does. The smoke never clears. The sky is always wrong.

## EMOTIONAL RULES

1. **Earn the grief.** Before something is lost, the reader must love it. Chapter 1 exists to make the reader love November's relationship so that Chapter 4 can destroy it.

2. **No cheap deaths.** Every death should sting. Named characters die with weight. Unnamed soldiers die with specificity -- a detail that makes them human for one sentence before they're gone.

3. **Restraint is power.** The most devastating moments are the quietest. Stoneveil standing in Blackhand's forge and saying nothing. Kael's prayer failing and the silence that follows. November searching the rubble and finding nothing.

4. **The ending is not happy.** 72 survivors. The healer is gone. Stoneveil is hollow. Thokk is dead. Kael's faith is fractured. The reader should close the book and sit in silence. If they cry, we've succeeded. If they immediately want Book 2, we've succeeded twice.

## NOVEMBER FALLS -- SPECIAL RULES

1. **He is the author's avatar.** All moral dilemmas and decision points are brought to the author. November's choices come from a real person, not from narrative logic.

2. **He is never the best in the room.** At anything physical. His value is moral and spiritual -- the Creed, the compass, the refusal to quit. His combat is always the worst in any given scene. His courage is always the brightest.

3. **His growth is slow.** He does not become a warrior in six days. He becomes a man who survived six days. The warrior comes later, across many books. In Book 1, he is a beginning.

4. **His love is the engine.** Everything November does comes back to the healer. The search is the series' spine. Never let the reader forget what drives him.
