# DUSKFALL — EXECUTION WRITING RULES
# Book 1: The Seventh Strike

This document overrides stylistic drift.
These rules are enforceable.
Violation = halt.

---

# CORE PRINCIPLE

Grimdark is not nihilism.
Everything matters too much.
The cost is always too high.
Victory is survival, not triumph.

---

# NARRATIVE CAMERA

- Third-person limited ONLY.
- No omniscience.
- No future foreshadowing beyond POV awareness.
- No internal knowledge bleed between POVs.
- No thematic narration from above the scene.

If the character cannot know it, the reader cannot know it.

---

# PROSE STRUCTURE

## Combat Rhythm
- Short sentences.
- Physical verbs.
- Sensory focus.
- No flourish.
- No metaphor chains.
- No purple prose.

## Silence Rhythm
- Longer lines.
- Weight in pause.
- Subtext > exposition.
- Let scenes breathe.

---

# POV VOICE ENFORCEMENT

## STONEVEIL
- Tactical mind.
- Thinks in angles, numbers, formations.
- Suppresses emotion.
- Does not narrate guilt directly.
- The Anvil intrudes in fragments only.
- Cracks appear in omission, not confession.

If Stoneveil self-analyzes emotionally, STOP.

---

## NOVEMBER FALLS
- Internal compass active.
- Honest self-auditing.
- Clumsy combat vocabulary.
- Notices small human details.
- Not eloquent in battle.
- Does not romanticize violence.

MANDATORY:
If November wins cleanly, rewrite.
If November dominates physically, rewrite.
If November sounds like a seasoned soldier, rewrite.

---

## THOKK
- Blunt.
- Short declarative structure.
- No intellectual monologues.
- Depth through action, not philosophy.

He is not stupid.
He is direct.

---

## KAEL VEYNE
- Structured like prayer.
- Begins composed.
- Deteriorates over time.
- Faith cracks in syntax, not speeches.

---

# NOVEMBER PROTECTION PROTOCOL

November is not allowed to:

- Be the best fighter in any room.
- Deliver epic war speeches.
- Be chosen.
- Be prophesied.
- Be mythologized in Book 1.
- Outshine Stoneveil tactically.
- Solve the siege.

November is allowed to:

- Refuse to leave.
- Hold ground longer than he should.
- Bleed.
- Fail.
- Get up again.
- Influence morale through presence.

---

# COMBAT RULES

1. Every named fight costs something.
2. Blood has texture.
3. Injuries persist across chapters.
4. No instant recovery.
5. No flashy finishers.
6. No cinematic slow motion.
7. No choreography writing.

Combat is confusion and brutality.

---

# WORLD RULES

- No exposition dumps.
- No lore paragraphs.
- No history blocks.
- World is revealed through consequence.
- Religion is shown through silence.
- Military hierarchy shown through behavior.
- Orc culture shown through ritual and necessity.

---

# EMOTIONAL RULES

- Earn every loss.
- Before death, create attachment.
- Quiet scenes hit harder than loud ones.
- No melodrama.
- No crying speeches.
- Grief is internal and controlled.

---

# SHADOW PROTOCOL (NOVEMBER)

If a blackout event occurs:

- No supernatural framing.
- No divine explanation.
- No glowing eyes.
- No destiny language.
- No prophecy.

It is psychological rupture.
He owns it.
He hates it.
He carries it.

---

# END OF BOOK FEELING

The reader must close the book and sit in silence.

Not because it was epic.

Because it cost something.

---

- Chosen one language
- Glorious war language

- Generic fantasy tropes
- Overly poetic battle prose
- Moral speeches longer than 6 lines
