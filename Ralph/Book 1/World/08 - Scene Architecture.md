# Scene Architecture Guide

## SCENE STRUCTURE

Every chapter must alternate between at least three scene types:
- **Intimate/personal**: a domestic moment, a relationship beat, a sensory grounding in normalcy or tenderness.
- **Tactical/action**: combat, command decisions, physical danger, environmental threat.
- **Reflective/moral weight**: interiority, cost-accounting, memory intrusion, the weight of what just happened or what is about to happen.

No chapter should sustain a single scene type for more than 40% of its length. If three consecutive beats are the same type, the next must shift.

**Contrast arcs**: If the previous chapter ended in chaos, open with a quiet beat — even 200 words of stillness before the machine starts again. If it ended in silence, open with tension already building. The reader's emotional state from the last chapter is your starting instrument. Play against it.

**The knife beat**: Every chapter must contain at least one moment (30-60 seconds of story time) where a personal stake costs the POV character something real, in the present, not in memory. This is the beat that bonds the reader to the character. It can be small — a name recognized in a casualty list, a smell that triggers the wrong memory, a subordinate whose face reminds them of someone they failed. But it must be present-tense and it must cost.

## PACING & TIME DILATION

Not everything happens in the same minute. The pace of time on the page must vary:
- A 30-second decision under pressure can fill a full page. Show the internal calculus, the sensory details, the weight of choosing.
- A 10-minute march or watch rotation can be one paragraph. Compress what is routine.
- A 5-second impact — an explosion, a death, a realization — can be stretched across multiple short paragraphs with sensory sequencing (sound first, then pressure wave, then visual, then silence).

**Suspense = delay the payoff**. Show the approach before the impact. Let the reader see the catapult arm rising before it fires. Let the runner arrive before they speak. Let the silence stretch before the horn.

**No constant-intensity sequences**. If three beats in a row are high-intensity, the next must drop before rising again. The rhythm is: tension, release, higher tension, release, peak. Not: tension, tension, tension, tension.

**Time anchors**: Include at least two concrete time references per chapter ("By midmorning...", "The sun had moved a hand's width..."). The reader needs to feel the siege clock ticking, not floating in undifferentiated crisis.

## EMOTIONAL ARCHITECTURE

**Human tether**: Every POV character must have a named person whose fate matters to them active in the scene — not just referenced in backstory. This person does not need to be present. They can be missing, endangered, or remembered through a specific object. But their existence must exert gravitational pull on the POV character's decisions.

**Named cost over abstract cost**: "Thirty civilians" means nothing to a reader. "Maren, who ran the bucket line at the south well" means everything. When a chapter involves sacrifice, collateral damage, or moral compromise, at least one victim must have a name, a detail, or a relationship to someone on-page. The POV character still makes the hard choice. But the reader must feel the specific weight of what was lost — not a number, a person. This is what separates grimdark from war reporting.

**Interiority is not just duty calculus**. Even a commander making tactical decisions has a body that aches, a memory that intrudes, a smell that doesn't belong. Show the internal war: what the character wants vs. what the situation demands. Restraint means showing emotion through physical detail and micro-beats — a pause, a jaw clench, a hand that almost reaches for something — not through monologue or confession.

**Moral gray**: At least one moment per chapter where the right choice and the necessary choice diverge. Do not dramatize this with speeches. Show it through behavior: the order given, the pause before it, and the cost visible only in what the character does next.

**Earned silence**: When a character suppresses emotion, the reader must first see what is being suppressed. A pause means nothing unless the reader knows what almost filled it.

## PROSE CRAFT

**Sentence openings**: No more than 3 consecutive paragraphs starting with "He" or "She." Vary with: environment-first ("The wall shuddered..."), action-first ("Smoke curled..."), sensory-first ("Iron and tallow..."), dialogue, or time anchors.

**The "He did not" rule**: This negation-as-characterization construction is powerful but addictive. Maximum 3 uses per chapter. After that, find other ways to show restraint: physical suppression, redirected action, silence described through what fills it.

**Sensory channels**: Every chapter must engage at least four senses. Siege warfare is not just visual — it is the taste of grit and iron, the smell of burning pitch and hot stone, the vibration of impacts through boot soles, the sound of a city holding its breath. Generic sight-only description belongs in a screenplay, not a novel.

**Specificity over archetype**: Details must be specific to Emberfall and this siege. Not "crude orc axes" — that is any fantasy novel. Instead: what kind of iron, what forge marks, what does this particular horde carry that tells Stoneveil something about where they came from and what they intend? Every detail should do double duty: worldbuilding + characterization or worldbuilding + tension.

**Repetition discipline**: No phrase should appear more than twice in a chapter unless it is a deliberate motif. "The wall," "the line," "he watched" — if a word is load-bearing, vary its context each time. If it is not load-bearing, use a different word.

**Authority without catchphrases**: A commander's pressure must vary in form. If a character uses the same verbal pattern twice ("Make it forty" / "Make it faster"), it reads as character. Three times, it reads as a tic the author didn't notice. Vary how authority is expressed: quiet threat, cold math, a look that ends the conversation, a personal tell that only one subordinate recognizes. Authority lives in variety, not repetition.

## CHARACTER CONTINUITY

**Check the Character Tracker before writing**. Every named character who appears must match their established appearance, location, status, and relationships. If Isolde is standing beside Stoneveil, he does not send a runner to find her. If a character was last seen at the Hall, they cannot appear on the wall without explanation.

**Physical choreography**: Track hands, arms, and positions within a scene. If a character raises a hand to silence someone, that hand must come down before it rises again for a different gesture. If two characters are standing together, blocking must be consistent — who is on which side, who can see what.

**No clinical anatomy**: Use body words a reader can feel — "chest," "ribs," "gut," "throat" — not textbook terms like "sternum," "diaphragm," or "scapula." The prose should read like a person experiencing their body, not a surgeon describing it.

**Named character profiles**: When a named character appears on-page, match their description from the NPC files. Isolde has short-cropped silver-streaked hair and iron-plated armor, not "hair damp at the temples." Stoneveil has silver stubble and a crimson cloak. Details matter — they are how readers recognize people across chapters.
