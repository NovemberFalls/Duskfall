# ElevenLabs Audio Book Reference (Studio + API)

Purpose
- Use this as the project reference for pushing chapters to ElevenLabs Studio (audiobook workflow) and via API.

Studio Workflow (UI)
- Create a Studio project and enable Chapters.
- Import a document with clear chapter headings to auto-detect chapters, or add chapters manually.
- Edit text, assign voices, and generate audio per chapter.
- Export chapters individually or as a full audiobook.

API Workflow (Studio)
- Create a Studio project from a document, URL, or structured JSON.
- Add chapters programmatically and push text into chapter blocks.
- Configure voice_id, model_id, and project metadata.

Key API endpoints (official docs)
- Create Studio Project: POST /v1/studio/projects
- Create Chapter: POST /v1/studio/projects/{project_id}/chapters

Chapter Content via API
- You can initialize a project or chapter with structured content.
- Content is structured as blocks with nodes containing text and voice_id.

Metadata and settings
- Project metadata supports title, author, description, genre, target audience, language, fiction/non-fiction, mature content.
- You can set quality_preset (standard/high/ultra/ultra_lossless).
- Voice settings can be overridden per project via voice_settings JSON.

Audio Text Guidelines (v3)
- v3 does not support SSML break tags. Use punctuation and audio tags for pauses.
- Use tags sparingly. Every dialogue line should have a tag in audio mode.
- Avoid overly fragmented, single-line sentences. Aim for novel-like paragraphs.
