# Book 1 -- The Seventh Strike
## Premise Document

### Logline
Six days. 850 defenders. 2,500 attackers. 72 survivors. The Blackroot Siege is the story of a city that refused to die -- and the man who burned pieces of himself to keep it standing.

### Core Concept
The Blackroot Siege (Year 99 of Duskfall) is a grimdark siege novel told from multiple POVs inside and outside the walls of Emberfall. Warden Alric Stoneveil -- a man already haunted by firebombing his own industrial district during the Black Anvil Revolt six months earlier -- must hold the Sundered Gate against the largest combined orc-goblin assault in Bloodhollow's history, led by Warlord Thokk Ironhide of the Ironclaw and Pyrelord Skrixx Blazebinder.

This is not a story about heroes. It is a story about what people become when survival demands the destruction of everything they believed about themselves.

### Tone & Style
- **Graham McNeill grimdark**: Morally compromised characters trapped in an impossible situation. No clean hands. No redemption arcs that feel easy. The "right" choice and the "necessary" choice are never the same thing.
- **Visceral, ground-level combat**: We are in the mud, the blood, the choking smoke. Battles feel like they cost something. Every wound matters. Every death has weight.
- **Industrial grime meets dark fantasy**: Emberfall is not a shining city. It is a furnace-city of black iron, soot-stained stone, and perpetual forge-smoke. The beauty is in the defiance, not the architecture.
- **Sparse, brutal prose**: Short sentences in combat. Longer, heavier passages in the quiet moments between. The rhythm of the language mirrors the rhythm of siege warfare -- bursts of violence separated by agonizing waiting.

### What This Book Is NOT
- It is not a quest narrative
- It is not a chosen-one story
- It is not a story where the good guys win clean
- It is not a story where war is glorious
- It is not a prelude -- it stands alone as a complete experience

### The Question the Book Asks
**What is the cost of survival when survival demands you become the thing you swore to destroy?**

Stoneveil firebombed the Anvil District to crush the Black Anvil Revolt. He killed workers, smiths, apprentices -- people he was sworn to protect. He did it because it was necessary. Now, six months later, necessity comes knocking again, and each day of the siege forces him to cross another line. The question is not whether he can hold the walls. The question is whether there will be anything left of the man behind them.

### Series Positioning
Book 1 is self-contained. The siege begins, the siege ends. But it naturally seeds:
- **Book 2**: The Battle of the Crimson Scar (3 months later, Jan Year 100) -- the war's final battle, where Captain Isolde Veyne inherits the broken pieces Stoneveil leaves behind
- **Book 3**: The Night of Falling Stars (overlapping timeline, Nov Year 99) -- the elven suicide mission, told from Aelindra Starweaver's perspective, showing the war's other front
- **Future books**: Post-war Bloodhollow, the undead threat from the north, the widening planar rifts

- *The Blade Itself* by Joe Abercrombie (character complexity, moral compromise)
- *The Poppy War* by R.F. Kuang (cost of power, wartime atrocity from the protagonist's side)
