# Book 1 — Named Character Tracker

This document tracks every named character who appears on-page, their status, and key details established in each chapter. Use this for continuity: if a character is introduced in one chapter, they must be consistent in all subsequent appearances.

**Rule**: Before writing a chapter, check this tracker for any character who carries over. Match their appearance, status, location, and last known action. If a character is referenced by name or title, they must match their established profile.

## RECURRING CHARACTERS (appear in multiple chapters)

### Warden Alric Stoneveil
- **Source**: `Bloodhollow/NPC - Leaders/Humans.md` + `World/01 - POV Characters.md`
- **Role**: Warden of the Sundered Gate. Primary POV (C02).
- **Appearance**: Towering, broad-shouldered, pale complexion. Black iron plate inscribed with wards, crimson cloak. Square jaw, silver stubble, cold eyes.
- **Key detail**: Title "The Unyielding Shield" (earned at Ashgate Approach). Never use title on-page as epic framing — it's background.
- **Trauma**: The Anvil District firebombing (6 months prior). Triggered by smoke/burning timber smell.
- **C02 status**: On the Sundered Gate rampart. Ordered gate sealed. Ordered cart burned (civilians outside sacrificed). Recognized Maren in the crowd. Eyes on the field as siege begins.

### Captain Isolde Veyne
- **Source**: `Bloodhollow/NPC - Leaders/Humans.md`
- **Role**: Ironbound Guard Captain. Stoneveil's right hand.
- **Appearance**: Tall, wiry. Sharp features. **Short-cropped, silver-streaked hair.** Burnished **iron-plated armor** maintained to mirror sheen. **"Hallowfang"** (double-edged longsword, Grimhaldir-forged) slung across back. Silver emblem of **Tyr** on belt.
- **Temperament**: Cold, unwavering duty. Stern but fair. Merciless in battle, compassionate to soldiers. "The fire in her heart burns colder than the steel in her hand."
- **Title**: "The Bastion's Talon" (earned at Battle of the Crimson Scar).
- **C02 status**: On rampart beside Stoneveil. Delivers reports. Uses his first name "Alric" once (rare, significant). Jaw tightens at "Burn it" order but does not argue. Last seen handling civilians in south passage.
- **CONTINUITY NOTE**: If Isolde is beside Stoneveil, do not have him send a runner to "report to Captain Veyne." He would turn to her directly.

### November Falls

- **Role**: Civilian aspiring defender. Primary POV (C01).
- **Appearance**: 5'10", broad-shouldered, dark brown hair (nearly black), full working man's beard. 27 years old.
- **Key detail**: Recovering alcoholic. The Defender's Creed. Horus is his anchor.
- **C01 status**: Morning routine with Horus. Walked to Hall of the Fallen. Horn sounded, impacts hit. Hall collapsed (west wing). Horus missing in rubble. Last seen searching.

- **Role**: Healer at the Hall of the Fallen. November's partner.
- **C01 status**: At the Hall when impacts hit. Missing after collapse. Double-knot linen with her soap scent found in rubble. Fate unknown.
