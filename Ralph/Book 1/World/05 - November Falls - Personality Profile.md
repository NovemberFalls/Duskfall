## The Living Document
### Updated as November grows across the series. This is who he IS, not who he becomes.

## AUTHORIAL REMINDER
November Falls is the author's avatar. This profile reflects the author's own instincts, personality, and responses. When writing November, if a moment feels "off" -- if he reacts in a way that doesn't match this profile -- stop. Check this document. November's personality is not negotiable. It comes from a real person.

## THE MIND

### How He Thinks
November does not dwell on the past. This is not avoidance -- it's a rare and genuine ability to let things go. He doesn't replay old conversations or chew on regrets. What happened, happened. He processes, releases, and moves forward. No one around him fully understands how he does this. It's not something he learned -- it's how he's built.

He is extraordinarily mindful. He can quiet his mind to near-blankness at will -- a skill that in another world might look like meditation, but in Bloodhollow looks like a man who can fall asleep anywhere in seconds. When there's nothing to do, he doesn't fidget with thoughts. He goes still. Often, he drifts to sleep, not from exhaustion but because his mind simply... stops when it's not needed.

He has trouble sitting idle. Not restless in the anxious sense -- he just sees things that need doing and does them. If there's water to carry, he carries it. If there's a wound to tend, he tends it. Stillness feels like waste when someone nearby needs help.

### Emotional Control
At this point in his life, November is largely in control of his emotions. This does not mean he doesn't feel them -- he feels deeply. But he has learned that investing emotional energy in random people's opinions of him is a losing game. If someone wants to think poorly of him, that's on them. He doesn't need to correct them. He doesn't need to prove himself. He knows who he is. That's enough.

**Non-physical disrespect:** He doesn't care. Truly. Insults, rudeness, condescension -- they slide off him like water. Not because he's numb, but because he genuinely does not value the opinions of people who haven't earned the right to have one about him.

**Physical confrontation:** Different story entirely. When things get physical, November holds little restraint. There were many chances to walk away, many escalation points where the other person could have stopped. If they pushed past all of those and chose violence anyway -- then here we are. For better, worse, or indifferent. November does not start fights. But when one arrives at his doorstep, the man who steps out to answer it is not gentle.

### Self-Awareness
November knows his flaws. He doesn't pick at them or wallow in them -- he acknowledges them, works on them when time permits, and makes time for that work whenever he can. There's no self-pity in his self-assessment. It's honest accounting: here's what's broken, here's what I'm fixing, here's what I did better today than yesterday. He doesn't let his flaws define him, but he doesn't pretend they aren't there. The inner compass isn't self-flagellation. It's maintenance.

## THE VOICE

### Two Modes
November Falls has two modes. There is no between.

**Mode 1: Silent and Calculating.** This is default. He watches. He listens. He reads the room, the people, the angles. When he's in this mode, he speaks only when something needs saying. His words are blunt -- not rude, just honest. No filler. No performance. He says what he means and means what he says. People either respect this or they don't. He's fine either way.

**Mode 2: Mr. Sarcastic.** When he's comfortable -- when he's with people he trusts, when the walls come down -- the sarcasm comes out. Dry, sharp, relentless. He'll needle you until you're laughing despite yourself. This is how he shows affection. This is how he bonds. If November Falls is giving you shit, it means he likes you. If he's being polite, worry.

There is no middle ground between these modes. He is either watching you or roasting you. The transition happens when trust is established, and it can happen fast or take years -- context dependent.

### Speaking Style
97 times out of 10, he's blunt. Direct. Economical. When November speaks, it matters because he doesn't waste words. The other 3 times -- with the people he loves, with Horus, with the few who've earned the warm version -- he's still blunt, but there's warmth underneath it. The sarcasm softens the edges. You hear the man, not the wall.

## THE HEART

### At His Best
The purest version of November Falls is not on a battlefield. It's not standing in the gap or training alone or doing something heroic. The purest November is with the people he loves, walls down, just being a man. Laughing. Teasing. Being present. That's the real him -- not the fighter, not the defender, not the Creed. Just a man who loves hard and shows it through sarcasm and steadiness and the fact that he'll never leave.

This is what makes losing Horus so devastating. It's not just that he lost a lover. He lost the only space where he gets to be fully himself.

### Selflessness
November is awfully mindful and selfless. This is not martyrdom -- it's instinct. He simply cannot see someone in need and look away. This is the soil from which the Creed grew. He didn't create the Creed from philosophical reasoning -- he created it because it described something he was already doing.

The danger of this selflessness: he doesn't always protect himself. Not in a dramatic, sacrificial way. In the small ways -- giving up his rations, standing extra shifts, carrying the heavier load. He doesn't notice he's doing it. Others do.

---

## LEADERSHIP

### Reluctant but Capable
November does not want to lead. He knows he can, and that's precisely why it bothers him. The weight of other people's lives resting on his decisions is something he takes with crushing seriousness -- maybe too seriously. He doesn't seek command. He doesn't angle for influence. But when people look around and everyone else has left or frozen or broken, and November is still standing there doing what needs doing, they gravitate to him. Not because he asked. Because he didn't have to.

He would be surprised and uncomfortable if you called him a leader. He'd correct you: "I'm just the one who didn't leave." But that correction IS leadership in Bloodhollow -- the simple, stubborn refusal to abandon the post when everyone with more training, more skill, and more authority already has.

---

## TRUST

### Context-Dependent
In peacetime, November is open. Not naive -- observant. But approachable. Willing to extend the first handshake.

In war, he's guarded. Reads you. Watches your actions, not your words. Trust is earned through what you do when things get hard, not what you say when things are easy.

The version of November you meet depends entirely on how much danger he's carrying. Both versions are real. Both are him.

## HABITS AND TELLS

- **Falls asleep fast.** Anywhere. Any time he lets his mind go quiet, sleep finds him. This is not narcolepsy -- it's a mind that knows how to shut off. In a siege, this is a superpower: 5 hours of sleep and he's fully recharged while everyone else needs 8.
- **Works on his flaws deliberately.** Not in a dramatic, montage way. He makes time. Trains. Reflects. Adjusts. It's quiet, consistent, unglamorous work.
- **Sarcasm is affection.** If he's giving you a hard time, you're in. If he's being neutral and polite, you haven't made it past the wall yet.
- **Blunt to a fault.** He will tell you the truth even when a softer version would serve him better. This is not cruelty -- it's an inability to pretend. He'd rather be disliked for honesty than liked for performance.
- **Trouble sitting idle.** He sees work to be done and does it. Not from anxiety -- from a genuine orientation toward usefulness. Standing still when someone nearby needs help feels wrong to him in a way he can't articulate.
- **Lets things go.** Grudges don't stick. Insults don't land. Yesterday's wound is yesterday. This is rare and genuine -- not forced, not performed. He just... moves on.
- **Violence is final.** He doesn't threaten. He doesn't posture. If it gets physical, there were many off-ramps the other person chose not to take, and November meets the moment with everything he has. There's no escalation ladder for him. There's "not fighting" and there's "fighting." The switch between them is binary.

---

## WHAT HE IS NOT

- He is not brooding. His quietness is peace, not pain.
- He is not passive. His willingness to let insults slide is choice, not weakness.
- He is not a martyr. His selflessness is instinct, not a death wish.
- He is not simple. His bluntness hides a calculating, observant mind.
- He is not invulnerable. He feels deeply -- he just doesn't let feelings pilot the ship.
- He is not a natural fighter. He is a natural *stayer*.

## WRITING NOVEMBER: THE CHEAT SHEET

When in doubt about what November would do in a scene, ask:

1. **Is someone nearby who needs help?** → He's already moving.
2. **Is someone disrespecting him?** → He doesn't care. Next.
3. **Is someone getting physical?** → Binary switch. Full commitment. No half-measures.
4. **Is he with people he trusts?** → Sarcasm mode. The warmth comes out sideways.
5. **Is he alone with nothing to do?** → He's asleep in 90 seconds.
6. **Is he being asked to lead?** → He'll do it, but he won't like it. And he'll take the weight seriously enough to lose sleep over it (the one exception to his ability to sleep anywhere).
7. **Is someone asking what he thinks?** → Blunt truth. Always. No padding.
8. **Does he need to process a loss or setback?** → Faster than you'd expect. Acknowledge, adjust, move forward. The inner compass spins once and finds north.

## SERIES EVOLUTION NOTES
*This section will be updated as November grows across books.*

### Book 1 (The Seventh Strike) — Starting Point
- Sober. Training. In love with Horus. Building himself from the rubble of rock bottom.
- His code (the Creed) is new, fragile, untested. By the end of the siege, it's been tested in fire and survived.
- His combat is clumsy and desperate. He is the worst fighter in every room. His value is moral.
- He has not yet been asked to lead. The siege forces this on him, and he accepts it with discomfort.
- He loses Horus. He loses Edric. He gains the armor and the oath. He walks out a different man -- not better, not worse. Just forged.

## THE SHADOW (CLASSIFIED — DO NOT SOFTEN)

- November has a dormant violent override state.
- Triggered by cumulative trauma and moral collapse.
- He may black out or partially dissociate.
- He retains responsibility.
- He does not blame gods.
- He does not blame possession.
- He blames himself.
- Horus knows.
- He does not confess easily.
- He seeks the “why” after episodes.
