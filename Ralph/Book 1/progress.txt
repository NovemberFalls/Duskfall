   - Character Bible (line 51): "Her name is Horus."
   - Book Overview (line 25): "a healer named Horus"
   - Chapter Outline Ch.1: "She tends to patients at the Hall of the Fallen"
   - PRD Ch.1: "She teases him about his swordwork"
   - No contradictions found. Name is consistent everywhere.

2. EDRIC THANE — DEATH TIMING: PASS

   - Chapter Outline Ch.23 (Day 6): November at a barricade, "The Man Who Would Not Leave"
   - PRD Ch.23: "EDRIC THANE DIES in this chapter"
   - Themes doc (line 18): "His death beside November"
   - Key Moments: Not listed as a standalone key moment (death is embedded in Ch.23)
   - Consistent: Edric dies on Day 6 in Chapter 23 beside November.

3. SKRIXX BLAZEBINDER SURVIVAL: PASS
   - POV Characters (line 131): "Survives the siege and escapes"
   - Foreshadowing (line 26): "Skrixx Blazebinder survives the siege"

   - Consistent across all documents.

4. EDRIC THANE — INTRODUCTION CHAPTER: PASS
   - PRD Ch.7: "Introduce Edric Thane here"

     (Note: Outline doesn't explicitly name Edric in Ch.7, but PRD does)
   - PRD Ch.11: "Deepen the bond with Edric Thane"
   - Consistent with POV Characters doc describing him as companion in composite unit.

   - Premise, POV Characters, Chapter Outline all use "Warden Alric Stoneveil"
   - Title "The Unyielding Shield" mentioned in POV Characters.
   - No contradictions.

6. THOKK'S DEATH METHOD: PASS
   - Chapter Outline Ch.25: "Seven strikes. On the seventh, Stoneveil's blade finds Thokk's throat."
   - Key Moments #9: "Seven strikes. Thokk dies standing."
   - POV Characters: "Seven strikes. Thokk falls."
   - Themes: "Seven strikes. Thokk falls."
   - All consistent.

7. SURVIVOR COUNT: PASS
   - "72 survivors" appears in: PRD, Chapter Outline, Key Moments, Themes, POV Characters.
   - No contradictions.

8. DEFENDER/ATTACKER NUMBERS: PASS
   - Defenders: "850 combat-ready" — Premise, Overview, Chapter Outline Ch.3, POV Characters
   - Attackers: "2,500+" — Premise, Overview, Chapter Outline Ch.2, POV Characters
   - Consistent everywhere.

9. KAEL VEYNE — RELATIONSHIP TO EDRIC: PASS
   - POV Characters (Kael section, line 107): "He is also Edric Thane's uncle."
   - POV Characters (Edric section, line 66): "He is Kael Veyne's nephew"
   - PRD Ch.17: "Edric appears among the defenders — Kael sees his nephew"
   - POV Characters (Kael, line 111): "pulled strings to get him assigned to the gate garrison"
   - All consistent.

10. CHAPTER COUNT: MINOR NOTE
    - PRD header says "28 chapters (Prologue + 26 chapters + Epilogue)"
    - Chapter Outline lists: Prologue + Ch1-26 + Epilogue (Ch27 + Ch28) = 28 total chapters
    - PRD numbers them 00-28 = 29 entries, but Ch27 (Conscription) and Ch28 (The Skull)
      are the Epilogue.
    - This is consistent — the numbering works as intended.

11. TIMELINE — 6 DAYS: PASS

    - Epilogue: Chapters 27-28 (days later)
    - Consistent across Themes emotional architecture and Chapter Outline.

12. KEY MOMENTS CROSS-REFERENCE: PASS
    - Key Moments doc lists 12 beats. All 12 match their chapter assignments in PRD.
    - #1 Last Good Morning → Ch.1 ✓
    - #2 The Blast → Ch.4 ✓
    - #3 First Kill → Ch.7 ✓
    - #4 Wounded Man → Ch.15 ✓
    - #5 Blackhand's Forge → Ch.18 ✓
    - #6 November's Dilemma → Ch.19 ✓
    - #7 Death Rites → Ch.8, Ch.12 ✓
    - #8 Failed Healing → Ch.21 ✓
    - #9 Seventh Strike → Ch.25 ✓
    - #10 The Search → Ch.26 ✓
    - #11 Conscription → Ch.27 ✓
    - #12 Silence After → Ch.28 ✓

13. NOVEMBER'S FIRST KILL — KEY MOMENT ASSIGNMENT: MINOR NOTE
    - Key Moments #3 says "November's First Kill (Ch. 7)"
    - Themes Day 2 (line 38): "Edric's first kill"
    - NOTE: Themes doc says "Edric's first kill" on Day 2, but Key Moments says it's
      NOVEMBER's first kill. The PRD Ch.7 confirms it is November who kills.
    - The "Edric's first kill" mention in Themes appears to be an error — it should be
      "November's first kill." Edric is a trained Legionnaire and likely already has kills.
    - FLAGGED: Themes doc Day 2 says "Edric's first kill" — should be "November's first kill."
      (Not fixing — planning docs are the author's territory.)

14. NOVEMBER'S DILEMMA — DECISION POINT STATUS: NOTE
    - Chapter Outline Ch.19 contains: "[DECIDED: November goes to the civilians...]"
    - Key Moments #6 also confirms the decision.
    - This decision point has already been resolved by the author.

15. CAPTAIN ISOLDE VEYNE: PASS
    - POV Characters: "Ironbound Guard Captain. Stoneveil's most reliable officer."
    - Foreshadowing: "Captain Isolde Veyne appears as a competent officer"
    - Chapter Outline Ch.3: "Captain Isolde Veyne reports: 850 combat-ready"
    - Consistent.

16. BLACKTHORN — FIRST NAME: PASS
    - POV Characters (line 137): "Lord Commander Aldric Blackthorn"
    - Note: Stoneveil's first name is also "Alric" (one L). Blackthorn is "Aldric" (with D).
    - Distinct names, no confusion expected.

SUMMARY:
  - Total issues found: 1 minor inconsistency
  - ISSUE #13: Themes doc Day 2 references "Edric's first kill" but it should be
    "November's first kill" per Key Moments and PRD. Not fixing — author's territory.
  - All other cross-references are CLEAN. Names, timelines, events, character relationships,
    and key moments are consistent across all 10 planning documents.
  - The planning foundation is solid. Ready for Phase 1 Tasks 2 and 3, then chapter writing.

[2026-02-18 23:55] EDRIC THANE CHARACTER SKETCH — Phase 1, Task 2

Wrote: Book 1/Noteworthy/04 - Edric Thane - Secondary Character.md

Character sketch covers:
  - Background: 19yo son of a blacksmith killed in Stoneveil's firebombing of the Anvil District.
    Enlisted because the pension wasn't enough. Kael Veyne's nephew — Kael pulled strings for
    gate garrison assignment.
  - Personality: Afraid but willing. Shakes before every assault, talks too much when scared,
    but stands his ground every time. Not brave — willing. That's the distinction.
  - Relationship with November: Latches onto him as an anchor. Not because November is skilled
    (Edric is the better fighter by training) but because November is steady. Follows conviction,
    not sword skill.
  - Heart-winning moment: Day 3 (Ch.11), during a lull — Edric tells November about his
    father's forge, the sound an anvil makes when struck right, falling asleep to that sound.
    Small, specific, devastating in retrospect.
  - Death: Day 6, Ch.23. Takes a wound, stays up, takes a second blow, goes down. November
    holds him. No last speech. Dies too fast, too afraid, reaching for someone's hand. The Creed
    in action: we do not abandon.
  - Thematic role: Theme #4 (Innocence as Currency). Bridges Kael and Stoneveil's arcs —
    the nephew of one, the orphan created by the other.

[2026-02-18 24:15] HORUS CHARACTER SKETCH — Phase 1, Task 3

Wrote: Book 1/Noteworthy/05 - Horus - The Healer.md

Character sketch covers:
  - Appearance & bearing: Lean, practical, calloused hands. Carries herself like someone who
    has already seen the worst thing today and chose to keep working. Dark eyes — warm when
    she lets them be, clinical when the work demands it.
  - Occupation: Healer at the Hall of the Fallen. Works among war-wounded and war-dead.
    Chose the work — not assigned, not obligated. Makes the same choice every morning.
  - What she means to November: Did not save him — he saved himself. She was the first person
    who looked at him without looking away. Steady, patient certainty that he was worth more
    than the broken man on her table. He hated her patience before he understood it.
  - Personality: Sharp when tired (tired most of the time). Teases November about swordwork,
    the Creed, his eating habits. Honest, not kind — or rather, her honesty IS her kindness.
    Refuses to agree with his worst assessment of himself.
  - Chapter 1 specifics: Saves him the heel of the bread. Blows hair from her face while
    elbow-deep in a wound. The silence between them that doesn't need filling. Morning light
    through the Hall's narrow windows. Two people eating together who know what solitude costs.
  - Reader attachment strategy: Love through accumulation of small, specific, irreplaceable
    details — so her absence feels like a limb torn away.

Phase 1 COMPLETE. All three pre-writing validation tasks finished. Ready for Phase 2.

[2026-02-18 25:00] PROLOGUE — THE ANVIL — Phase 2, Task 1

Wrote: Book 1/Chapters/00 - Prologue - The Anvil.md

POV: Warden Alric Stoneveil
Setting: The Anvil District, night of the Black Anvil Revolt (6 months before the siege)
Target: 3,000-4,000 words. Estimated ~3,200 words written.

Chapter covers:
  - Stoneveil on the wall above Forge Road, ordering the incendiary bombardment
  - The barricades burn first, then the buildings on Forge Road
  - Captain Harren reports: eastern and western perimeters sealed, tunnel exits blocked
  - Stoneveil orders the incendiaries concentrated on the Black Anvil (the main forge)
  - Harren's hesitation — noncombatants inside, apprentices, families — overruled
  - The Black Anvil burns: the forge-fire feeds the alchemist's pitch, crucible cracks,
    molten slag pours into lower chambers where noncombatants sheltered
  - Forge-King Drelgar Blackhand — last seen standing at his anvil, hammer raised,
    finishing his work as the forge collapses around him. Dies standing.
  - Stoneveil watches until the screaming stops. Does not look away. Does not flinch.
  - Lieutenant Daskell reports: district contained, ~200 rebels escaped through sewers
  - Stoneveil delivers the report: "The Black Anvil Revolt is over. The Forge-King is dead."
  - A young runner (14-15yo) brings scout reports: Ironclaw movement along the ridgeline.
    Six months, maybe less.
  - Stoneveil does not comfort the boy. Does not explain. Gives his next order.
  - Final image: Stoneveil composing his report in his mind. The language comes easily.
    It always does.
  - Forward-reference planted: Stoneveil will return to this exact spot during the siege
    (Ch.18) and the 43 children killed will become all he can think about.

Voice notes:
  - Military precision maintained throughout — controlled, measured, no cracks visible
  - Emotional weight carried in what Stoneveil DOESN'T say or think about
  - The 43 noncombatants under 16 are noted but deliberately suppressed
  - Drelgar Blackhand's death given dignity — he dies as a smith, not as a rebel
  - Grimdark tone established: no clean heroes, cost is everything

Continuity checks:
  - Stoneveil's rank: Warden ✓
  - Drelgar Blackhand: Dwarf, Forge-King, dies at forge ✓
  - 900+ casualties (912 in final count, matching worldbuilding doc) ✓
  - Captain Isolde Veyne not present (she appears in Ch.3) — no contradiction ✓
  - Blackthorn referenced as Lord Commander, physically distant ✓
  - Ironclaw scout reports foreshadow the siege ✓

[2026-02-18 26:00] CHAPTER 1 — THE LAST GOOD MORNING — Phase 2, Task 2

Wrote: Book 1/Chapters/01 - The Last Good Morning.md

POV: November Falls
Setting: Emberfall, the Hall of the Fallen and the training yard. Morning before the siege.
Target: 3,000-5,000 words. Estimated ~4,200 words written.
KEY MOMENT: #1 — The Last Good Morning

Chapter covers:
  - November wakes before dawn (5-hour sleep cycle established). Watches Horus sleeping.
  - Trains alone in the empty training yard with a warped wooden practice blade.
  - Sloppy, self-taught swordwork — drops his guard on the left side every time (per
    Writing Rules: November is NEVER the best fighter, combat is clumsy and civilian).
  - Returns to the Hall of the Fallen. Horus is elbow-deep in a dock worker's shoulder wound.
  - She notices his blister, diagnoses his swordwork problems from the injury pattern.
  - They share bread in the alcove behind the linen shelves — she saved him the heel.
  - She teases him about his training ("Badly and stubbornly and at an hour when no one
    is awake to see"). Banter is honest, not cruel — the language of people who trust
    each other with the truth.
  - November recites the full Creed to her. The silence after is "the best silence he knew."
  - He walks the Hall with her — helps with patients, sits with a widow whose husband died
    in the night. Shows November being useful in ways that aren't combat.
  - Horus tells him: "Anyone could have sat with her. You did." — the compass confirmed.
  - November checks the inner compass: Standing. Sober. Useful. Loved. Closer than yesterday.
  - Returns to the training yard. Drops his guard on the left side. Resets. Tries again.

Voice notes:
  - November's POV is honest, internal, raw but not chaotic (per Writing Rules)
  - Inner compass used as structural device — self-checking against the Creed
  - Combat descriptions are civilian: "hitting a piece of wood for an hour", "a man hitting
    a door with a stick" — no military vocabulary
  - Horus rendered through accumulation of small, specific details: the hair she blows from
    her face, the heel of bread saved without being asked, the shoulder pressed briefly
    against his. Love through specifics, not abstraction (per Horus character sketch).
  - No melodrama. No declarations of love. Two people eating bad bread in thin light.
  - The reader should love what November loves so that losing it hurts.

Foreshadowing planted:
  - The Hall of the Fallen established as a location (it's near the blast site in Ch.4)
  - Training yard and practice routine established (borrowed sword in Ch.7 will be different)
  - November's physical limitations clearly shown (drops guard on left side)
  - His 5-hour sleep cycle mentioned (pays off in Ch.11 when he stands extra shifts)
  - The Creed recited in full for the first time
  - His brother referenced indirectly through family losses ("the war took his father and
    the skirmishes took his mother")
  - The widow scene seeds November's instinct to sit with the dying (relevant throughout)

Continuity checks:
  - November's age: 27 ✓ (not stated explicitly, but consistent with timeline)
  - Horus: healer at the Hall of the Fallen, goes by Horus, no surname ✓
  - Physical description: Green eyes, dark hair, full beard, broad-shouldered, 6'2" —
    not explicitly restated (shown through action, not description per Writing Rules)
  - The Creed: exact text matches Character Bible ✓
  - Forge-smoke, soot-stained setting: Emberfall rendered as industrial grime city ✓
  - No info-dumps: world shown through experience, not exposition ✓
  - Tone: Tender but grounded. Grimdark in the bones (the widow, the wounded, the war
    that took his family) but quiet on the surface. Chapter 1 exists to make Ch.4 hurt.

[2026-02-18 27:00] CHAPTER 2 — THE HORIZON DARKENS — Phase 2, Task 3

Wrote: Book 1/Chapters/02 - The Horizon Darkens.md

POV: Warlord Thokk Ironhide
Setting: The ridge above Emberfall, dusk before the siege (Day 1)
Target: 3,000-4,000 words. Estimated ~3,500 words written.

Chapter covers:
  - Thokk surveys Emberfall from the ridge: three rings, the Sundered Gate, the flanks.
    Identifies weak points — eastern wall patched twice, western wall over soft ground.
  - Army review: 1,200 Ironclaw warriors, 800 goblin sappers with siege engines,
    500 Revenants (Bane's Kissed) held in reserve.
  - Skrixx's siege engines described: the Jawbreaker (trebuchet), catapults with
    alchemist's fire, unreliable but effective. Skrixx characterized as chaotic,
    useful, kept at arm's length.
  - Grimtusk da Bonechanter reads the bones: omens UNCLEAR. Spirits present but
    confused — "like smoke in wind." Blood flows in every direction. Spirits are
    thinning, connections to ancestors weakening. Something wrong in the deep places.
  - Grimtusk reveals: bones showed the number SEVEN. Doesn't know what it means.
    (Foreshadowing: the seventh strike that kills Thokk in Ch.25)
  - War-Chiefs council at dusk: four leaders introduced:
    * Malga Bonefist — vanguard commander, goes first, accepts the cost
    * Krogan Bloodtusk — eastern assault, old loyalty, deep voice
    * Gharza Splitjaw — western approach, argues with Thokk, usually right
    * Urzag the Quiet — reserve, speaks rarely, silence carries weight
  - Assault plan laid out: dawn bombardment on gate and east, sappers under west,
    vanguard hits gate, reserve waits for the break.
  - The central argument: two winters before the Ironclaw starve. Hunting grounds
    failing, fishing halved, farms failed. This siege is survival, not glory.
  - Thokk alone on the ridge: thinks about Bloodtide Bay, the children, his dead
    wife's last words ("the children needed to eat"), the weight of the skull he
    carries, the chain of Warlords.
  - Does not hate the humans. Understands them. Recognizes the mirror — both sides
    defending what they have.
  - Final image: Thokk walks down the ridge toward his people. The dark comes in
    behind him.

Voice notes:
  - Orcish cadence maintained: blunt, declarative, short muscular sentences
  - Dialect used in Grimtusk's speech (phonetic orcish: "da" for "the", "dey" for
    "they", "ya" for "you") — consistent with military docs
  - Thokk's internal monologue is deeper than his speech: strategic, grieving,
    self-aware. The depth beneath the bluntness, per Writing Rules.
  - No info-dumps: orc culture shown through action (bone-reading, war-council,
    rank structure, death rites referenced)
  - Theme #2 (The Enemy is a Mirror) established: Thokk recognizes human desperation
    as a reflection of his own

Foreshadowing planted:
  - SEVEN STRIKES: Grimtusk sees the number 7 in the bones (pays off Ch.25)
  - Spirits thinning/confused: early sign of Veilfire corruption spreading (series arc)
  - Skrixx Blazebinder characterized but kept peripheral (survives siege, future books)
  - Revenants (Bane's Kissed) introduced: undead forces, foreshadow northern threat
  - Thokk's skull/chain-of-Warlords imagery: foreshadows his own death standing
  - Krogan Bloodtusk named (leads remnant force in Book 2 after Thokk's death)
  - Stonehaven referenced in passing (buried detail per Foreshadowing doc)

Continuity checks:
  - Army count: 2,500+ (1,200 orcs + 800 goblins + 500 Revenants) ✓
  - Thokk's rank: Warlord / Blood-Chief / Blood-Crowned ✓
  - Grimtusk: Head War-Shaman, old, copper-capped tusks, milky grey eyes ✓
  - Skrixx: Pyrelord, goblin siege engineer, chaotic but effective ✓
  - Emberfall geography: three rings, Sundered Gate facing north, Iron Marches ✓
  - Timeline: Day 1, assault planned for dawn (matches Ch.3-4 sequence) ✓
  - Tone: grimdark but not nihilist. Thokk is humanized. Reader should understand
    his desperation before the first arrow flies. ✓

[2026-02-18 28:00] CHAPTER 3 — THE SUNDERED GATE — Phase 2, Task 4

Wrote: Book 1/Chapters/03 - The Sundered Gate.md

POV: Warden Alric Stoneveil
Setting: The Sundered Gate, the Iron Marches, Emberfall. Day 1, before the siege opens.
Target: 3,000-4,000 words. Estimated ~3,800 words written.

Chapter covers:
  - Stoneveil stands before the Sundered Gate at dawn, reads the rune-wards pulsing
    brighter — dwarven work that responds to proximity of threat
  - Captain Isolde Veyne delivers the troop report: 850 combat-ready
    (600 Legionnaires, 120 Ironborn, 80 auxiliaries, 50 war-mages/artillery)
  - The Ironbound Guard will NOT be redeployed — Blackthorn's standing orders keep
    them in the Emberheart, defending the inner ring and the Lord Commander
  - Stoneveil inspects the full circuit of the Iron Marches:
    * Eastern section: patched wall at the river bluff (breach point, different stone,
      horizontal grain — visible from the ridge). Foundation not deep-surveyed.
    * Guard towers: twelve total, every 200 paces. From the nearest, Stoneveil sees
      the smoke beyond the ridge — thicker than yesterday.
    * Western flank: subsidence over old mining tunnels. Orders tunnels sealed, bricked,
      mortared. Listening posts at unreachable entrances. Second row of stakes added.
  - Veyne asks "How long?" — Stoneveil answers: "Dawn. Maybe sooner."
  - Runner delivers scroll from Lord Commander Blackthorn:
    * Ironbound Guard will not be redeployed
    * "Hold the outer ring. Buy time."
    * Reinforcement requests "dispatched" to northern border garrisons (3 weeks away)
    * Stoneveil reads the word "dispatched" and understands: no help is coming
  - Officer briefing on the ramparts (not behind closed doors — confidence is a resource):
    * Stoneveil gives the numbers plainly. Does not mention Emberheart or Ironbound.
    * "The outer ring will be held."
  - Veyne delivers defensive plan: four-hour watches, Ironborn on vulnerable sections,
    auxiliaries in reserve, war-mage pairs on bastions, ballista crews on towers 3/7/11
  - Veilfire Spire coordination: Archmage Raventhorne commits 15 war-mages to wall defense,
    holds remainder for "Spire operations"
  - Stoneveil eats standing up — salt meat at the parapet, watching the Veil's Throat
  - Final image: Stoneveil alone on the wall at nightfall, rune-wards pulsing, waiting

Voice notes:
  - Military precision maintained: controlled, measured, disciplined sentences
  - Stoneveil's POV thinks in tactical terms — angles, numbers, positioning
  - Emotional weight carried in what he DOESN'T say or think about
  - The Anvil and the forty-three deliberately suppressed — "He did not think about
    the Anvil. He did not think about the forty-three."
  - Anger at Blackthorn contained: "He kept his anger the way he kept his sword —
    sheathed, maintained, ready for the moment it was useful."
  - The math is the recurring motif — Stoneveil does the math, says nothing

Foreshadowing planted:
  - Eastern wall patch visible from the ridge (Thokk saw it in Ch.2 — convergence)
  - Western tunnels and mining subsidence (goblin sappers will exploit this)
  - Ironbound Guard kept in reserve (they never come — the political failure)
  - "Dispatched" reinforcements (they never arrive)
  - Veilfire Spire doing something beyond wall defense (Raventhorne's "Spire operations")
  - Rune-wards pulsing brighter throughout the chapter (building urgency)
  - Captain Isolde Veyne established as Stoneveil's most reliable officer (Book 2 setup)

Continuity checks:
  - Stoneveil's rank: Warden ✓
  - Captain Isolde Veyne: Ironbound Guard Captain, tall, wiry, sharp features,
    burnished armor ✓ (matches POV Characters and worldbuilding docs)
  - Troop count: 850 combat-ready ✓ (matches all planning docs)
  - Enemy count: 2,500 ✓ (referenced via the 3:1 ratio)
  - Lord Commander Blackthorn: Aldric Blackthorn, physically distant, in the
    Emberheart/High Keep ✓
  - Ashgate reference: consistent with Prologue (Stoneveil held Ashgate, 420 survivors) ✓
  - Sundered Gate description: dark iron, rune-wards, two bastions ✓ (matches Ch.2)
  - Veil's Throat: narrow kill zone approach, consistent with worldbuilding ✓
  - Timeline: Day 1, assault expected at dawn — bridges to Ch.4 ✓
  - Forge-smoke, industrial grime: consistent with Ch.1 and Ch.2 descriptions ✓
  - Stoneveil's rule from Prologue: "You watch what you order" — character consistency ✓
  - Western wall soft ground / mining tunnels: matches Ch.2 (Thokk/Skrixx noted this) ✓
  - Eastern wall patched twice: matches Ch.2 (Thokk identified this) ✓

[2026-02-18 29:00] CHAPTER 4 — THE FIRST THUNDER — Phase 2, Task 5

Wrote: Book 1/Chapters/04 - The First Thunder.md

POV: November Falls
Setting: The Hall of the Fallen, the outer ring, Emberfall. Day 1, the siege opens.
Target: 3,000-5,000 words. Estimated ~4,800 words written.
KEY MOMENT: #2 — The Blast

Chapter covers:
  - November in the training yard, working the sweep (left-side gap), blister reopened
  - First siege engine impacts on outer wall — sound, shockwave, the world changing
  - November runs toward the Hall of the Fallen, through panicked civilians
  - Reaches the Hall: staff already evacuating patients to back rooms
  - The blast: a goblin siege round hits the eastern wall of the Hall directly
  - November thrown across the room — deaf, blinded by dust, left arm injured
  - Crawls through rubble toward the overflow ward where Horus was last seen
  - Overflow ward ceiling collapsed — digs through rubble with one hand
  - Does not find her. Finds empty pallets, destroyed equipment, but not Horus
  - Soldiers evacuating the Hall pull him out — "building's cleared"
  - In the square: soldiers run past, he is invisible, a civilian, nobody's priority
  - Searches the streets: checks every stretcher, every cart, every body
  - She is not among the wounded. Not among the dead he can find.
  - Sergeant blocks him from re-entering the Hall — "accessible areas swept"
  - Secondary gate closing — November must choose: stay in bombardment zone or pass through
  - Steps through the gate into the middle ring
  - In the middle ring: checks hundreds of faces among refugees. She is not among them.
  - Compass check: Standing. Sober. Alive. Not enough. But it was what he had.

Voice notes:
  - November's POV maintained: honest, internal, raw but not chaotic
  - Combat/blast descriptions are civilian: no military vocabulary, disorientation is total
  - The concussive blast written as sensory erasure — hearing gone, vision white,
    the body registering force before the mind can process it
  - November's search is desperate but structured by the compass — even in chaos,
    the inner mechanism is working
  - Military indifference shown through specific interactions: the soldier who drags
    him out, the sergeant who blocks him, the gate that closes behind him
  - Horus's absence is the central wound — not confirmed dead, not confirmed alive,
    the void worse than an answer
  - The morning from Ch.1 deliberately echoed: the heel of bread, the bandage on
    his hand, the light through the window, the sweep with the left-side gap — all
    invoked to measure the distance between "before" and "after"

Foreshadowing planted:
  - Alchemist's fire established as goblin weapon (consistent with Ch.2 Skrixx description)
  - War-mages on bastions with veilfire (Veilfire Spire active during battle)
  - The secondary gate between outer ring and middle ring (retreat path for Ch.14-15)
  - Horus's disappearance: not confirmed dead — the absence that drives the series
  - November's invisibility as a civilian (sets up his volunteer enlistment in Ch.7)
  - His injured left arm (wound carries forward into subsequent chapters)

Continuity checks:
  - Training yard: same yard from Ch.1, same time of day, same blister ✓
  - Practice blade: warped, cracked grip, leather wrapping — matches Ch.1 ✓
  - Horus's bandage on his hand: tied with "quick, overlapping passes" — exact match ✓
  - Hall of the Fallen: layout matches Ch.1 (main ward, alcove, linen shelves,
    overflow ward, converted storage rooms) ✓
  - Junior healer: new character, consistent with Hall staff ✓
  - Ember fall geography: outer ring (Iron Marches), middle ring (Anvil), inner ring
    (Emberheart) — matches Ch.3 ✓
  - Siege engines match Ch.2: Jawbreaker, catapults, alchemist's fire ✓
  - Rune-wards on eastern bastion cracking: consistent with Ch.3 description of
    wards pulsing brighter as danger approaches ✓
  - Secondary gate: consistent with three-ring structure ✓
  - November's Creed: exact text matches Character Bible ✓
  - Compass structure: Standing/Sober/Useful/Loved from Ch.1 → Standing/Sober/Alive
    in Ch.4 — the degradation is intentional, showing loss ✓
  - Forge-smoke, industrial grime: consistent with all previous chapters ✓
  - Timeline: Day 1, assault at dawn — matches Ch.2 (Thokk's plan) and Ch.3
    (Stoneveil's prediction) ✓

[2026-02-18 30:00] CHAPTER 5 — THE PRAYER — Phase 2, Task 6

Wrote: Book 1/Chapters/05 - The Prayer.md

POV: Inquisitor Adept Kael Veyne
Setting: The Cathedral of Tyr's Judgment, the Emberheart (Inner Ring), Day 1 during the siege.
Target: 3,000-4,000 words. Estimated ~3,800 words written.

Chapter covers:
  - Kael kneels in the Cathedral at dawn, offering the morning prayer. Silence answers.
    Establishes his relationship with silence as normative — not absence but patience.
  - First siege impacts arrive through the floor as tremors during his Fourth Petition.
    He does not stop praying. Faith overrides the physical world.
  - The armoury chapel: Kael blesses 43 weapons (23 swords, 11 spears, 7 axes, 2 crossbows)
    using the Consecration Rite. Anointing oil with veilfire extract. Two-hour process.
    Number 43 deliberately echoes the 43 noncombatants under 16 from the Prologue.
  - Walks the Inner Ring: observes the Ironbound Guard drilling in the Gauntlet Grounds
    under Commander Thornwall. Notes their excellence. Notes they are HERE, not on the wall.
    Does not question the Chain of Command — files it as Tyr's design.
  - The Veilfire Spire: flames brighter than usual. Archmage Raventhorne doing something
    beyond stated purpose. Kael holds a key to the Bound Sanctum. Raventhorne requested
    seal re-verification two days ago. The Spire is reaching, not just burning.
  - Fifteen war-mages deploy to the outer wall. Kael offers a private, informal prayer for
    them — not theology, just a man hoping they come back.
  - Returns to Cathedral. Watches the wounded flowing past the Inner Gate through the
    western transept windows. Stretchers. Carts. The machine processing its casualties.
  - Writes the Petition of Endurance inscriptions — vellum with consecrated ink, placed
    beneath the altar for the Garrison to pass.
  - The private prayer: Kael prays for Edric. Breaks form — not the Rite, not liturgy,
    just a man asking a god to protect a boy he placed in danger. Reveals the full weight
    of having pulled strings to get Edric assigned to the gate garrison.
  - Final image: Kael alone in the nave, evening light, the silence absolute. "It did not
    trouble him. Yet." The word "yet" lives beneath the prayer like a crack in marble.

Voice notes:
  - Formal, liturgical prose maintained throughout — Kael's inner monologue structured like
    prayer (petition, confession, assessment). Sentences are longer, more complex, with
    subordinate clauses that mirror theological reasoning.
  - Distinction enforced between "offered" and "recited" prayer — Kael catches himself
    reciting rather than offering when watching the wounded. First hairline crack.
  - The Chain of Command presented as divine architecture — Kael does not question it because
    questioning it would require examining whether the system he serves is the same as the
    god he serves. This will fracture later.
  - Private prayer for Edric breaks every formal rule Kael follows — no Rite, no formula,
    just raw petition. This is the human beneath the inquisitor.
  - The thought Kael stops himself from completing ("the first step on the road that led to
    men like —") is about High Inquisitor Varian Marrow. Foreshadows Ch.13.

Foreshadowing planted:
  - Silence of the gods: established as Kael's central condition. He interprets silence as
    patience. This interpretation will be tested (Ch.9, 13, 21).
  - Edric Thane on the wall: Kael placed him there. The guilt is pre-loaded for Ch.17
    when Kael sees his nephew among the defenders and cannot pull him off the line.
  - Veilfire Spire brighter than usual: "reaching, not just burning." Raventhorne's "Spire
    operations" referenced from Ch.3. Seeds for series arc.
  - Varian Marrow: present by absence — the thought Kael will not complete. Foreshadows
    Ch.13 where Marrow sentences a deserter to death.
  - 43 weapons blessed: deliberate echo of the 43 children from the Prologue's firebombing.
    Kael does not make this connection. The reader might.
  - The Scales of Veilfire moved to a vault — light still falls where they were. Pattern
    continues without the object. Metaphor for the gods' departure from the world.
  - Kael's position straddling Inquisition and Spire — key to the Bound Sanctum, eyes for
    both Marrow and Raventhorne. Political tension seeded.

Continuity checks:
  - Kael's rank: Inquisitor Adept ✓ (matches POV Characters and military docs)
  - Kael's role: Warden of the Warded Archive at the Veilfire Spire ✓
  - Cathedral of Tyr's Judgment: bronze and iron towers, Hall of Scales, Bell of Penance,
    Shrine of the Martyrs ✓ (matches worldbuilding docs)
  - Ironbound Guard: drilling under Commander Thornwall, not deployed to outer wall ✓
    (matches Ch.3 — Blackthorn's standing orders)
  - Veilfire Spire: obsidian, green-blue flames, Archmage Raventhorne ✓ (matches Ch.3)
  - War-mages deploying: 15 committed to wall defense ✓ (matches Ch.3 Veyne's report)
  - Siege timing: bombardment during Day 1, matches Ch.4 timeline ✓
  - Edric Thane: 19yo, Kael's nephew, assigned to gate garrison ✓ (matches POV Characters)
  - High Inquisitor Varian Marrow: referenced obliquely ✓ (matches POV Characters)
  - Inner Ring geography: wider streets, statues, restricted access ✓ (matches worldbuilding)
  - Kael's voice: formal, liturgical, structured like prayer ✓ (matches Writing Rules)
  - Sister Reva Caelum: Keeper of Shrine of Martyrs ✓ (matches worldbuilding NPC docs)
  - Commander Hadric Thornwall: Commander of Garrison ✓ (matches worldbuilding NPC docs)

Phase 2 COMPLETE. All six Day 1 chapters (Prologue + Ch.1-5) finished. Ready for Phase 3.

[2026-02-18 31:00] CHAPTER 6 — THE WAVE — Phase 3, Task 1

Wrote: Book 1/Chapters/06 - The Wave.md

POV: Warden Alric Stoneveil
Setting: The Iron Marches, the Sundered Gate, Day 2 — first full assault.
Target: 3,000-4,000 words. Estimated ~3,800 words written.

Chapter covers:
  - Dawn assault: orcs hit the Sundered Gate and outer wall simultaneously — coordinated
    assault on eastern flank with scaling ladders at three points, ram crews at the gate
  - Stoneveil commands from the gate rampart with Captain Veyne beside him
  - Eastern breach: three ladder points, two repulsed, third establishes on the parapet.
    Grieve's auxiliaries committed, Ironborn hold, breach contained in 11 minutes.
    Four dead, nine wounded.
  - Gate assault: ram crews hit the Sundered Gate with iron-banded rams. Rune-wards
    flare and repulse the rams. Archers and oil from murder holes devastate the
    Veil's Throat. Forty-three orc dead in the Throat (number echo from the Anvil).
  - Second assault at midday: harder, more coordinated. Enemy adapts — testudo
    formations, heavier ram crews, faster ladder deployment. Eastern wall buckles —
    Legionnaires pushed back, Ironclaw warriors establish on parapet. Ballista three
    redirected to cut the ladder supply line. Breach contained. Eight dead, fourteen
    wounded.
  - Supply assessment: arrows 70%, bolts 60%, alchemy stores 55%. Three to four days
    at current rate. Oil reduced to half-rations.
  - Rune-ward degradation: bombardment leaching enchantment, dwarven work spending
    stored power. Wards will fail — not today, not tomorrow, but they will fail.
  - No third assault — orc commander pulls back to regroup. Silence that is reloading.
  - Final count: 809 effective (27 dead, 41 wounded, 19 returning, 6 critical)
  - Stoneveil alone on the wall at nightfall: the machine works, the numbers are wrong

Voice notes:
  - Military precision maintained: controlled, measured, disciplined sentences
  - Stoneveil's POV thinks in ledger terms — inputs, outputs, expenditure rates,
    the arithmetic of blood
  - The "machine" metaphor recurring: the defensive system as a machine that runs
    until it breaks. Stoneveil is the operator who knows it's breaking.
  - Emotional weight in the forty-three echo: orc dead in the Throat = children
    in the Anvil. Stoneveil notices, files it, discards it — but the reader shouldn't.
  - Veyne's competence shown through action: the slate, the reports, the calculations
    running behind her eyes. She and Stoneveil communicate in the language of officers
    who have already arrived at the same answer.
  - The auxiliaries: they can fight, not well, not long, but they can fight. Seeds
    their later role in the composite units.

Foreshadowing planted:
  - Western flank quiet: the goblin sappers are not visible. They're either in reserve
    or already underground. The silence from below is ominous.
  - Rune-ward degradation: the dwarven enchantments are finite and being spent. The gate
    will eventually become ordinary iron, and ordinary iron breaks.
  - Blackthorn's continued silence: no communication from the Emberheart. Ironbound
    Guard remains uncommitted. Political failure deepening.
  - Supply rates: three to four days at current expenditure. The siege has six days.
    The math is the math.
  - Enemy adaptation: the orc commander is learning. Each assault is better coordinated.
    The testudo, the faster ladders, the heavier ram crews — the pressure will increase.

Continuity checks:
  - Stoneveil's rank: Warden ✓
  - Captain Isolde Veyne: beside him, slate, stylus, precise reports ✓ (matches Ch.3)
  - Troop count: 850 → 809 effective after Day 2 losses ✓
  - Veil's Throat: killing ground, 50ft wide, 200ft long, murder holes, arrow slits ✓
    (matches Ch.3)
  - Rune-wards: pulsing, dimmer than yesterday ✓ (progressive from Ch.3)
  - Eastern wall patch: identified as weak point in Ch.2 (Thokk) and Ch.3 (Stoneveil) ✓
  - Western tunnels: sealed, listening posts active ✓ (matches Ch.3 orders)
  - Blackthorn's dispatch: referenced, Ironbound Guard still uncommitted ✓ (matches Ch.3)
  - Ballista on tower three: mentioned in Ch.3 deployment ✓
  - Salt meat at the parapet: Stoneveil eating standing up ✓ (matches Ch.3)
  - Skrixx's engines: Jawbreaker, catapults, alchemist's fire ✓ (matches Ch.2)
  - "You watch what you order": Stoneveil's rule from the Prologue ✓
  - Forty-three echo: from the Prologue (43 children) ✓
  - Forge-smoke/industrial haze: consistent ✓
  - Timeline: Day 2, first full assault ✓ (follows Day 1 bombardment in Ch.4)
  - Hall of the Fallen blast referenced: eastern bastion ward fracture from Ch.4 ✓
