FINDINGS — Issues identified:

1. HEALER NAME CONSISTENCY: PASS
   - "Horus" is used consistently across all documents.
   - Character Bible (line 51): "Her name is Horus."
   - Book Overview (line 25): "a healer named Horus"
   - Chapter Outline Ch.1: "She tends to patients at the Hall of the Fallen"
   - PRD Ch.1: "She teases him about his swordwork"
   - No contradictions found. Name is consistent everywhere.

2. EDRIC THANE — DEATH TIMING: PASS
   - POV Characters (line 68): "He dies during the siege" / "His death on Day 6"
   - Chapter Outline Ch.23 (Day 6): November at a barricade, "The Man Who Would Not Leave"
   - PRD Ch.23: "EDRIC THANE DIES in this chapter"
   - Themes doc (line 18): "His death beside November"
   - Key Moments: Not listed as a standalone key moment (death is embedded in Ch.23)
   - Consistent: Edric dies on Day 6 in Chapter 23 beside November.

3. SKRIXX BLAZEBINDER SURVIVAL: PASS
   - POV Characters (line 131): "Survives the siege and escapes"
   - Foreshadowing (line 26): "Skrixx Blazebinder survives the siege"
   - PRD Ch.25: "Skrixx Blazebinder escapes with surviving goblin forces"
   - Consistent across all documents.

4. EDRIC THANE — INTRODUCTION CHAPTER: PASS
   - PRD Ch.7: "Introduce Edric Thane here"
   - Chapter Outline Ch.7: "He picks up a dead man's sword and falls in"
     (Note: Outline doesn't explicitly name Edric in Ch.7, but PRD does)
   - PRD Ch.11: "Deepen the bond with Edric Thane"
   - Consistent with POV Characters doc describing him as companion in composite unit.

5. STONEVEIL'S RANK/TITLE: PASS
   - Called "Warden" consistently across all documents.
   - Premise, POV Characters, Chapter Outline all use "Warden Alric Stoneveil"
   - Title "The Unyielding Shield" mentioned in POV Characters.
   - No contradictions.

6. THOKK'S DEATH METHOD: PASS
   - Chapter Outline Ch.25: "Seven strikes. On the seventh, Stoneveil's blade finds Thokk's throat."
   - Key Moments #9: "Seven strikes. Thokk dies standing."
   - POV Characters: "Seven strikes. Thokk falls."
   - Themes: "Seven strikes. Thokk falls."
   - All consistent.

7. SURVIVOR COUNT: PASS
   - "72 survivors" appears in: PRD, Chapter Outline, Key Moments, Themes, POV Characters.
   - No contradictions.

8. DEFENDER/ATTACKER NUMBERS: PASS
   - Defenders: "850 combat-ready" — Premise, Overview, Chapter Outline Ch.3, POV Characters
   - Attackers: "2,500+" — Premise, Overview, Chapter Outline Ch.2, POV Characters
   - Consistent everywhere.

9. KAEL VEYNE — RELATIONSHIP TO EDRIC: PASS
   - POV Characters (Kael section, line 107): "He is also Edric Thane's uncle."
   - POV Characters (Edric section, line 66): "He is Kael Veyne's nephew"
   - PRD Ch.17: "Edric appears among the defenders — Kael sees his nephew"
   - POV Characters (Kael, line 111): "pulled strings to get him assigned to the gate garrison"
   - All consistent.

10. CHAPTER COUNT: MINOR NOTE
    - PRD header says "28 chapters (Prologue + 26 chapters + Epilogue)"
    - Chapter Outline lists: Prologue + Ch1-26 + Epilogue (Ch27 + Ch28) = 28 total chapters
    - PRD numbers them 00-28 = 29 entries, but Ch27 (Conscription) and Ch28 (The Skull)
      are the Epilogue.
    - This is consistent — the numbering works as intended.

11. TIMELINE — 6 DAYS: PASS
    - Day 1: Chapters 1-5 (Gathering Dark)
    - Day 2: Chapters 6-9 (First Blood)
    - Day 3: Chapters 10-13 (The Grind)
    - Day 4: Chapters 14-17 (The Break)
    - Day 5: Chapters 18-21 (The Anvil)
    - Day 6: Chapters 22-26 (The Seventh Strike)
    - Epilogue: Chapters 27-28 (days later)
    - Consistent across Themes emotional architecture and Chapter Outline.

12. KEY MOMENTS CROSS-REFERENCE: PASS
    - Key Moments doc lists 12 beats. All 12 match their chapter assignments in PRD.
    - #1 Last Good Morning → Ch.1 ✓
    - #2 The Blast → Ch.4 ✓
    - #3 First Kill → Ch.7 ✓
    - #4 Wounded Man → Ch.15 ✓
    - #5 Blackhand's Forge → Ch.18 ✓
    - #6 November's Dilemma → Ch.19 ✓
    - #7 Death Rites → Ch.8, Ch.12 ✓
    - #8 Failed Healing → Ch.21 ✓
    - #9 Seventh Strike → Ch.25 ✓
    - #10 The Search → Ch.26 ✓
    - #11 Conscription → Ch.27 ✓
    - #12 Silence After → Ch.28 ✓

13. NOVEMBER'S FIRST KILL — KEY MOMENT ASSIGNMENT: MINOR NOTE
    - Key Moments #3 says "November's First Kill (Ch. 7)"
    - Themes Day 2 (line 38): "Edric's first kill"
    - NOTE: Themes doc says "Edric's first kill" on Day 2, but Key Moments says it's
      NOVEMBER's first kill. The PRD Ch.7 confirms it is November who kills.
    - The "Edric's first kill" mention in Themes appears to be an error — it should be
      "November's first kill." Edric is a trained Legionnaire and likely already has kills.
    - FLAGGED: Themes doc Day 2 says "Edric's first kill" — should be "November's first kill."
      (Not fixing — planning docs are the author's territory.)

14. NOVEMBER'S DILEMMA — DECISION POINT STATUS: NOTE
    - Chapter Outline Ch.19 contains: "[DECIDED: November goes to the civilians...]"
    - Key Moments #6 also confirms the decision.
    - This decision point has already been resolved by the author.

15. CAPTAIN ISOLDE VEYNE: PASS
    - POV Characters: "Ironbound Guard Captain. Stoneveil's most reliable officer."
    - Foreshadowing: "Captain Isolde Veyne appears as a competent officer"
    - Chapter Outline Ch.3: "Captain Isolde Veyne reports: 850 combat-ready"
    - Consistent.

16. BLACKTHORN — FIRST NAME: PASS
    - POV Characters (line 137): "Lord Commander Aldric Blackthorn"
    - Note: Stoneveil's first name is also "Alric" (one L). Blackthorn is "Aldric" (with D).
    - Distinct names, no confusion expected.

SUMMARY:
  - Total issues found: 1 minor inconsistency
  - ISSUE #13: Themes doc Day 2 references "Edric's first kill" but it should be
    "November's first kill" per Key Moments and PRD. Not fixing — author's territory.
  - All other cross-references are CLEAN. Names, timelines, events, character relationships,
    and key moments are consistent across all 10 planning documents.
  - The planning foundation is solid. Ready for Phase 1 Tasks 2 and 3, then chapter writing.

[2026-02-18 23:55] EDRIC THANE CHARACTER SKETCH — Phase 1, Task 2

Wrote: Book 1/Noteworthy/04 - Edric Thane - Secondary Character.md

Character sketch covers:
  - Background: 19yo son of a blacksmith killed in Stoneveil's firebombing of the Anvil District.
    Enlisted because the pension wasn't enough. Kael Veyne's nephew — Kael pulled strings for
    gate garrison assignment.
  - Personality: Afraid but willing. Shakes before every assault, talks too much when scared,
    but stands his ground every time. Not brave — willing. That's the distinction.
  - Relationship with November: Latches onto him as an anchor. Not because November is skilled
    (Edric is the better fighter by training) but because November is steady. Follows conviction,
    not sword skill.
  - Heart-winning moment: Day 3 (Ch.11), during a lull — Edric tells November about his
    father's forge, the sound an anvil makes when struck right, falling asleep to that sound.
    Small, specific, devastating in retrospect.
  - Death: Day 6, Ch.23. Takes a wound, stays up, takes a second blow, goes down. November
    holds him. No last speech. Dies too fast, too afraid, reaching for someone's hand. The Creed
    in action: we do not abandon.
  - Thematic role: Theme #4 (Innocence as Currency). Bridges Kael and Stoneveil's arcs —
    the nephew of one, the orphan created by the other.

[2026-02-18 24:15] HORUS CHARACTER SKETCH — Phase 1, Task 3

Wrote: Book 1/Noteworthy/05 - Horus - The Healer.md

Character sketch covers:
  - Appearance & bearing: Lean, practical, calloused hands. Carries herself like someone who
    has already seen the worst thing today and chose to keep working. Dark eyes — warm when
    she lets them be, clinical when the work demands it.
  - Occupation: Healer at the Hall of the Fallen. Works among war-wounded and war-dead.
    Chose the work — not assigned, not obligated. Makes the same choice every morning.
  - What she means to November: Did not save him — he saved himself. She was the first person
    who looked at him without looking away. Steady, patient certainty that he was worth more
    than the broken man on her table. He hated her patience before he understood it.
  - Personality: Sharp when tired (tired most of the time). Teases November about swordwork,
    the Creed, his eating habits. Honest, not kind — or rather, her honesty IS her kindness.
    Refuses to agree with his worst assessment of himself.
  - Chapter 1 specifics: Saves him the heel of the bread. Blows hair from her face while
    elbow-deep in a wound. The silence between them that doesn't need filling. Morning light
    through the Hall's narrow windows. Two people eating together who know what solitude costs.
  - Reader attachment strategy: Love through accumulation of small, specific, irreplaceable
    details — so her absence feels like a limb torn away.

Phase 1 COMPLETE. All three pre-writing validation tasks finished. Ready for Phase 2.
