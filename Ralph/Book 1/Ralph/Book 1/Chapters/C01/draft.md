# C01 — The Last Good Morning

November woke before the bells. He always did.

The room was still gray, the light coming thin through the slats. Horus lay on her side facing him, hair loose on the pillow, breath steady. The blanket had twisted between them in the night. He slid an arm out from under it, slow, so he didn't pull it off her.

He lay there a moment and let his mind go quiet. The weight in his chest stayed, but it wasn't crushing. It was just there. A thing he carried. He didn't fight it. He breathed and let it be.

Five hours. Maybe six. It was enough.

He rolled out of bed and set his feet on the floor. The boards were cold. The city never quite warmed, even with the forges running. Emberfall was heat and smoke and soot, but it held its warmth like a stone holds a sunbeam. It looked hot from a distance and felt cold when you touched it.

He pulled on his pants and shirt. Folded the blanket up over Horus' shoulder. She moved but didn't wake. He paused with his hand on the edge of the blanket until her breathing stayed even. Then he crossed the room, boots in hand, and opened the door.

The corridor outside was quiet. A neighbor's baby cried once and went silent. Somewhere down the hall a kettle hissed. The Hall of the Fallen never really slept, but in the early morning it held itself like a chest before a cough.

November laced his boots in the stairwell and went down. He washed his face at the basin by the back door and stood there a moment, palms on the stone, letting the cold water run between his fingers. It helped.

He took the bucket and went out into the alley.

The sky over Emberfall was still dim. The forges in the mid-rings left a low red glow against the clouds, but this early the smoke thinned. You could see the color of the day if you looked up. It was a pale, stubborn blue.

He walked to the public pump. Two women were already there, one older, one young with a scarf over her hair. The older one nodded. The younger didn't look up. November set his bucket down and worked the handle.

Water came up slow and cold, iron in the taste. He filled the women's buckets first without saying anything. They didn't ask. The older one nodded again and carried hers away. The younger one finally glanced at him and gave a quick, shy half-smile. He nodded once. Nothing more needed.

He filled his own. The handle creaked with each pull. His shoulders felt the work. He didn't mind. It was small and real and there was no thinking in it.

On the way back he stopped at the front step and set the bucket down. His neighbor, a man with a missing finger and a swollen knee, came out with a cane. November picked up the bucket again and walked it inside. The man muttered thanks and leaned on the cane to get up the steps. November didn't wait for more.

Inside, the Hall smelled like old linen and ash and bitter herbs. The infirmary was quiet at this hour, though he could hear someone coughing behind a curtain. He poured water into the washing basins. He did not look behind the curtains. It wasn't his place.

He carried the rest up to their room. Horus was sitting now, back against the wall, hair tied up in a loose knot, the blanket pulled around her shoulders. She held a cup and stared into it as if she could see yesterday in the bottom.

“You left,” she said.

“You were asleep.”

“You were quiet,” she said. “That's worse.”

He set the bucket down, poured water into the pitcher, and leaned it against the wall. “I was careful. You're not a baby.”

She smiled. It was small, but it got under his guard.

He poured two cups. She took one. Their fingers brushed. He could have held on. He didn't. He sat on the edge of the bed.

“You're up early again,” she said.

“Always.”

“Maybe once you could sleep in. See what it does to the world.”

He looked at her. “You'd miss me.”

“You're full of yourself.”

“Only with you.”

She snorted, then drank. The steam warmed her face. He watched it for a second before he remembered himself. He was not supposed to stare. He was supposed to be better than the man who stared.

He took a sip from his cup. The water was clean enough to drink but still tasted like metal. He didn't care. The heat mattered.

They sat in the quiet a moment. Outside, the city woke up. Boots on stone. A cart wheel squeaking. A distant hammer striking. The noises were muted, as if the walls still hadn't decided to open their eyes.

“Did you sleep?” he asked.

“Like a rock,” she said. “Only woke twice. Once because you rolled over. Once because some idiot in the hall knocked a tray over.”

“Could have been me. I'm an idiot in the hall.”

“You? No. You'd have picked it up.”

He couldn't argue.

She watched him drink. “You're steady lately.”

“Trying.”

“You're not trying. You're doing.”

He set the cup down on the floor. “You know how this works. One day at a time.”

“You've said that every morning for two months.”

“Because it's true every morning.”

Horus leaned her head back against the wall. “They're saying the gates might close today.”

He felt that and let it pass. “Who?”

“Everyone. The cooks. The porters. The guards who came through for bandages last night. It's all anyone talks about.”

He nodded once. He didn't say anything else. He had no words that would make it better or worse. He wasn't a soldier. He wasn't in on whatever decisions were made up in the stone and iron. He didn't pretend to be.

Horus sipped her water. “If the gates close, the Hall will fill.”

“It's already filling.”

“Then it will fill more.”

He looked at his hands. The knuckles were still raw from training. Calluses on the palms. The skin would crack again when he wrapped the hilt the wrong way. He flexed them once, slow.

“Did you go to the yard yesterday?” she asked.

“After shift.”

“And?”

“I got hit more than I should have.”

She raised an eyebrow. “So the world hasn't changed.”

He gave her a look that said don't push me. She smiled anyway.

“Edric says you take hits like a wall,” she said.

“Edric is nineteen and hasn't met a real wall.”

“He likes you.”

“I don't know him.”

“You know his posture. You know his breathing. You know when he's lying.”

He shrugged. “He swings his sword like he expects it to do the work for him.”

“That's called ‘being nineteen.’”

He didn't argue. He rolled his shoulders, feeling the old stiffness there. He thought about the bottle the way he used to. Thought about the way his hands shook when he went too long without it. That was gone now. The tremor had burned out. Sometimes he still tasted it in the back of his mouth, the sour rot of old ale. But it was a memory now, not a hunger.

Horus saw his face and let him sit in it without touching him. That was her. She didn't fix. She didn't crowd. She was a steady thing in a world that moved too fast.

“Do you regret it?” she asked.

“What?”

“The training. The hours. The bruises. The way you go quiet sometimes.”

He stared at the floor. “No.”

“Do you regret who you were?”

He exhaled once. The question was gentle, but it carried a sharp edge. He didn't like thinking about the man he used to be. Not because he missed him. Because he had been so small.

He chose his words. “He kept me alive. That's all I can say for him.”

“And the man now?”

“He's still learning.”

She nodded. “That's the answer I wanted.”

He looked at her then, really looked. The line of her jaw. The way she held her cup in both hands, fingers wrapped around it like she could pull warmth into herself. The small scar on her lower lip from a patient who had bitten her in a fever last winter. The way she didn't flinch when he was quiet.

He wanted to say something that would make the moment stay. He didn't. He didn't have a talent for that. He knew how to hold a door. He knew how to carry a bucket. He knew how to not drink. The rest he was still learning.

A soft knock came at the door.

“Come in,” Horus said.

The door cracked and a boy stuck his head in. He had a round face and a mop of hair that wouldn't behave. “Sorry to bother. The linen cart's stuck. The wheel's caught.”

Horus looked at November. “You're going to help.”

“I'm going to help,” he said.

He stood and went down the hall. The linen cart was halfway through a turn and jammed against the corner. A porter, red in the face, tried to lift it and didn't have the leverage. November put his shoulder under it and lifted. The wheel cleared the edge. The porter muttered thanks and rolled it away.

“Where to?” November asked.

“Basement,” the porter said. “Full of blood. Again.”

He didn't say anything to that.

He went back to the room. Horus had pulled on her boots and was tying the straps. She looked up. “Basement?” she asked.

“Basement.”

She stood and tightened the last strap. “I'll see you at mid-day.”

“I'll be in the yard.”

“You'll be getting hit.”

“Probably.”

She stepped close and put a hand on his chest. “Don't break the same rib twice. It's bad practice.”

He looked down at her hand and then at her face. “I'll try.”

“Try harder.”

He leaned down and kissed her. It was brief. It didn't need to be more. When he pulled back, she was smiling, and something in his chest eased.

She turned to go. He caught her wrist, gentle. “Horus.”

“Mm?”

“Be careful.”

She looked at him like that was the most obvious thing in the world. “You're not my mother.”

“No.”

“But I hear you.”

She left. He watched her go until the stairwell swallowed her. Then he picked up his training wraps and followed the linen cart down to the basement.

The Hall's lower rooms were cool and damp. The smell of bleach and herbs was stronger there, layered over iron and sweat. He worked with the porters, stacking clean linens, hauling dirty ones to the wash. It was simple work. He liked it. People spoke to him in passing. He answered when they asked a question. No one tried to talk more than that. It was early. Everyone was busy.

He kept his mind on his hands. The motions were easy. Lift. Fold. Stack. Carry. The rest of the world stayed outside the room. That was the best kind of morning.

By late morning he was in the yard behind the Hall. The yard was small and walled, with a patch of dirt worn down to packed earth. Two men were sparring with blunted blades. Another one worked a straw dummy. A couple of women practiced shield work, pushing and stepping, their movements tight and stiff.

November took his place and wrapped his hands. He kept his own sword at home. He didn't have one that was his yet. He borrowed a training blade from the rack. It was heavier than it should have been. He didn't complain.

A man named Brok stepped toward him with a grin. Brok was older, with a broken nose and a laugh that came out like a cough. He'd been a miner and fought like one. Short, heavy, no finesse.

“Ready?” Brok asked.

“No,” November said.

“Good,” Brok said. “Neither am I.”

They went at it. November's feet were wrong. He knew it the moment he moved. Brok's blade slapped his forearm and left a sting. November grunted and backed off. He tried to shift his weight the way Edric had shown him. It didn't help. Brok came in again, shoulder first, and knocked him back. November caught himself before he fell.

“Your balance is a drunk man's,” Brok said.

“I'm not drunk,” November said.

“Your balance doesn't know that.”

Brok came in again. November raised his blade, too late. The strike caught his ribs. It wasn't full force, but it hurt. He exhaled through the pain and reset his stance.

He didn't like this part. He wanted to be better. He wanted to skip to the part where his hands knew what to do without thinking. There was no skipping. So he took the hits and went again.

He managed one good parry, felt the jolt up his arm, and took a step in. Brok's elbow met his chest and his breath came out in a sharp burst. He didn't go down. He kept his feet and backed away.

“Again,” Brok said.

They went three more rounds. November got hit in the shoulder, the ribs, the thigh. He landed two glancing blows and one solid tap to Brok's wrist that made the older man shake his hand out.

“Better,” Brok said.

“Still wrong,” November said.

“Always wrong.” Brok grinned. “That's why we train.”

November nodded. He wiped sweat from his forehead. His shirt stuck to his back. The yard smelled like dirt and metal and bodies. He liked it.

Edric Thane came over, eyes bright, sword in hand. “You're late,” Edric said.

“I was moving linens,” November said.

Edric looked him up and down. “You look like you got hit.”

“That's the point.”

Edric snorted. “Want to go?”

“No.”

“Come on.”

November exhaled. “Fine.”

Edric's stance was too wide. He knew it and didn't care. He was nineteen. He had energy to burn and wanted to burn it. November didn't want to break him. He wasn't sure he could, even if he wanted to.

They traded a few light strikes. Edric was fast and sloppy. November was slow and clumsy. He blocked more than he should and got tagged twice. When he landed a hit it was because Edric overextended and walked into it. He felt the impact in his wrist more than he saw it on Edric's body.

“You're not trying,” Edric said.

“I am,” November said.

“No, you're not.”

November stepped back. “You're going to get yourself killed if you keep doing that.”

Edric frowned. “Doing what?”

“Thinking speed makes up for everything else.”

“It does sometimes.”

“Not against someone who knows what to do.”

Edric set his jaw. “You're not one of those.”

November smiled without meaning to. “Exactly.”

Edric laughed, then swung. November blocked, took a step, and caught Edric's shoulder with the flat. It was a decent hit. Edric shook it off.

“You're stubborn,” Edric said.

“That's all I've got,” November said.

He handed the training blade back to the rack when they were done and sat on the low wall to catch his breath. The air had warmed. The distant clanging of forges cut in and out with the wind. He could see smoke rising over the roofs.

Horus came into the yard with two cups. She held one out. “Drink,” she said.

He took it. The tea was bitter. He drank anyway. He looked at the line of sweat at her temple and the way she stood with her weight in her hips. She was tired. She was always tired. And still she came out with tea.

“Basement was busy?” he asked.

“Always,” she said. “We had two from the lower ring. No names. One of them kept asking for his mother.”

He didn't know what to say. “Did he live?”

“Not yet,” she said. “We'll see.”

He nodded. He didn't ask more. He didn't need to. He knew the Hall's rhythm. He knew that the answer would change by evening.

Edric sat on the wall a few feet away, legs swinging. “Horus,” he said, “is it true you can stitch a cut closed without a needle?”

“No,” she said. “Unless you want to drink a new kind of tea.”

Edric laughed. “She's mean to me.”

“She likes you,” November said.

Edric rolled his eyes. “That's worse.”

Horus smirked. “He knows me too well.”

They sat together in the morning sun that didn't quite warm the stones. For a few minutes the city felt almost ordinary. November let his mind go quiet again. He listened to the small sounds. A cart rolling. Someone calling for bread. The scratch of Edric's boots on the wall.

He thought about the man he had been. He saw the dim corner of a tavern, his head on a table, his stomach sour with drink. He saw his hands shaking. He saw himself trying to stand and falling back into the chair. He didn't like the memory, but it didn't cut him anymore. It was a fact. It was a place he had been. He was not there now.

He looked at Horus and at the yard and at the sun. He was here.

He didn't say any of it.

A horn sounded in the distance. Low and long.

Horus stiffened. Edric straightened. The sound cut through the yard like a blade. November stood without thinking. The horn sounded again, joined by another, overlapping and urgent.

“That’s the wall,” Edric said.

Horus had already turned toward the hall. “Back inside,” she said. “Now.”

November's hands were still warm from the tea. They felt suddenly empty.

A second sound followed the horn, deeper, more like the groan of stone. The air trembled. The yard wall shivered under his palm when he reached for it.

Then the impact came. It was distant, but it shook the ground like a fist. A plume of dust rose over the rooftops, and a moment later the sound rolled over them, low and heavy.

Horus swore under her breath. “Get inside.”

He was already moving. The yard emptied, people running for the hall. November followed Horus through the doorway. The corridor was chaos. Someone dropped a tray. Someone else shoved past, shouting that the gates were closing. He didn't see who.

Another impact. Closer. The floor shook. Plaster dust fell from the ceiling. A child screamed. November grabbed the nearest doorframe as the hall lurched.

“Down!” someone yelled.

The next blast came without warning. A roar, a crash, the sound of stone breaking. The floor tilted. Light went out. He was thrown forward and down, shoulder striking a wall, ribs flaring with pain. Something hit his head. The world went dark and loud at once.

He came back in fragments.

Dust. Heat. A high ringing that wouldn't stop. The taste of grit. He pushed himself up on his hands and coughed. The air was thick, full of smoke and powdered stone. He couldn't see more than a few feet.

“Horus?” he said. His voice came out raw. “Horus?”

No answer. Just coughing and the low groans of people in the dark.

He crawled forward, hands feeling over broken boards and fallen plaster. His shoulder ached. His head throbbed. He kept moving.

“Horus!”

A beam had come down across the corridor. He tried to lift it and couldn't. He shifted, found a gap, pulled himself through. Someone grabbed his ankle. He looked down and saw a porter with blood on his face. The man mouthed something. November couldn't hear it. He grabbed the man's wrist and pulled. The porter slid free, coughing, and crawled away into the smoke.

November turned back into the corridor. The dust was thicker here. He could see daylight through a tear in the wall at the far end. Rubble piled against it, and beyond that was the open street.

He climbed over the rubble. Stones shifted under him. A broken plank cut his palm. He didn't feel it until he saw the blood.

Outside, the city had changed. Smoke rolled between buildings. People ran in every direction. The air was full of grit and fire.

He looked back at the tear in the wall, then at the street. He saw a woman carrying a child. A man dragging another by the shoulders. No sign of Horus.

“Horus!” he called. It was a shout, but it sounded small.

He moved into the street, turning, searching faces, scanning the ground. He didn't see her.

Another horn sounded. Closer now. The sound of iron on stone. Shouts from the wall. The city was waking into something else.

He went back to the breach and looked again. Nothing.

“Horus!”

No answer.

He stood in the street with dust on his skin and blood on his hand and the ringing in his ears. People pushed past him. He didn't move. He couldn't.

Then he did. He forced his legs to go, to search, to move through the smoke. He checked the nearest doorway. He looked under a fallen beam. He called her name until his throat burned.

Nothing.

He stood in the middle of the street, breathing smoke, hearing nothing but the ringing in his head and the far-off horns.

Silence and smoke.
