# The Seventh Strike — Edit Pass PRD
# Prose Quality Overhaul

> **The first draft is complete. It has the right bones — story beats, character arcs,
> emotional moments. But the prose reads like bullet points wearing a story's clothes.**
>
> This edit pass applies the lessons learned from the Chapter 1 rewrite. Every chapter
> gets the same surgical treatment: cut the explaining, kill the repetition, trust the
> reader, inject dread where peace exists, and let the scenes breathe through action
> and dialogue instead of narration.
>
> **Target: Cut total word count from ~188,000 to ~90,000-110,000.**
> That means most chapters lose 30-50% of their words. Quality over quantity.

## The Rules of the Edit

Before touching ANY chapter, read these rules. They are non-negotiable.

### 1. KILL THE EXPLAINING
If a moment lands, do not explain why it landed. If the bread heel shows love, do not
write a paragraph about what bread heels mean. If a silence says everything, do not
follow it with narration telling the reader what the silence said.

**Test:** After every paragraph, ask: "Does the next paragraph explain what just happened?"
If yes, delete the next paragraph.

### 2. KILL THE REPETITION
If a character trait, detail, or emotional beat appears more than twice in a chapter,
cut it to two occurrences maximum — ideally one introduction and one callback.

**Test:** Search the chapter for repeated phrases, images, or ideas. If the same concept
appears 3+ times, it's a crutch. Cut to the two strongest instances.

### 3. TRUST THE READER
Do not tell the reader what to feel. Do not tell them what a character's expression means.
Do not explain subtext. If two characters share a look and the reader understands, do not
follow it with "and in that look was everything they couldn't say."

**Test:** Remove every sentence that begins with "It was as if," "He knew that," "She
understood that," "This was the moment," "What it meant was." Read without them. If the
scene still works, they were dead weight.

### 4. VARY THE RHYTHM
The original drafts have a single rhythm: long introspective paragraph, long introspective
paragraph, long introspective paragraph. Alternate. Short punchy dialogue. Then a longer
observation. Then a two-word sentence. Then silence. The prose rhythm should mirror the
content — fast in combat, slow in grief, staccato in shock.

### 5. INJECT DREAD (Chapters 1-5 only)
In the pre-siege and early-siege chapters, thread small details that signal danger without
announcing it. More supply carts than usual. Runners with scroll cases. A soldier who
pauses mid-sentence and looks north. The military machine shifting gears around civilians
who don't have the clearance to know why. SUBTLE. Not horns. Not dramatic foreshadowing.
Just the world getting a little wrong around the edges.

### 6. DIALOGUE DOES THE HEAVY LIFTING
Wherever the draft uses narration to convey information or emotion that could be shown
through dialogue, convert it. Two people talking reveals more than two paragraphs of
internal monologue. The original Chapter 1 had the "How was the post?" / "Still standing." /
"Pity." exchange — that reveals their entire relationship in three lines.

### 7. PRESERVE EVERY STORY BEAT
Do NOT cut plot points, character introductions, key moments, foreshadowing seeds, or
emotional beats. Cut the FAT, not the BONE. Every scene in the chapter outline must
survive the edit. Cut how they're told, not what's told.

### 8. POV VOICE CONSISTENCY
Each POV has a distinct voice (see Writing Rules doc). Verify during edit:
- **Stoneveil:** Military precision. Controlled. Cracks show in what he DOESN'T say.
- **November:** Honest, blunt, internal compass. Clumsy in combat. Two modes: silent/calculating or sarcastic.
- **Thokk:** Blunt. Declarative. Short muscular sentences. Depth beneath simplicity.
- **Kael:** Formal. Liturgical. Structure breaks down as faith cracks.

### 9. NOVEMBER-SPECIFIC RULES
- He is NEVER the best fighter. His combat is always the worst in the scene.
- His value is moral — the Creed, the compass, the refusal to quit.
- Two modes only: silent/calculating OR sarcastic. No in-between.
- Sarcasm = affection. If he's roasting someone, he trusts them.
- He doesn't dwell on the past. He processes, releases, moves forward.
- He falls asleep fast when idle. Mind goes blank at will.
- Blunt. Always. No padding. No performance.
- Read `05 - November Falls - Personality Profile.md` before EVERY November chapter edit.

### 10. THE CHAPTER 1 STANDARD
The rewritten Chapter 1 (`01 - The Last Good Morning.md`) is the quality standard.
Read it before starting ANY edit. Match its density, its rhythm, its trust in the reader.
Every edited chapter should feel like it belongs in the same book as that chapter.

## Phase 1 — Day 1 Chapters (The Gathering Dark)

- [x] **Edit Prologue — THE ANVIL:** Read `00 - Prologue - The Anvil.md` (currently ~3,600 words). This chapter was flagged as "genuinely good" in review — it needs lighter editing than most. Focus on: tightening any repeated imagery, cutting explanatory passages after strong moments (e.g., if the hammer scene already lands, don't explain it), verifying Stoneveil's voice is military-precise with cracks showing in silence. Target: 2,500-3,500 words. Overwrite the existing file.
- [x] **Edit Chapter 2 — THE HORIZON DARKENS:** Read `02 - The Horizon Darkens.md` (currently ~4,300 words). Thokk POV. Apply all edit rules. Verify orcish voice: blunt, declarative, short muscular sentences. Cut any narration that explains orc culture instead of showing it through Thokk's actions/decisions. Grimtusk's bone-reading should be shown, not described. Target: 2,500-3,500 words. Overwrite.
- [x] **Edit Chapter 3 — THE SUNDERED GATE:** Read `03 - The Sundered Gate.md` (currently ~5,700 words). Stoneveil POV. Heavy cut needed — almost double target length. Cut repeated tactical descriptions. The math of 850 vs 2,500 should hit once, hard. Isolde Veyne's introduction should be clean and quick — she's being seeded, not featured. Target: 3,000-4,000 words. Overwrite.
- [x] **Edit Chapter 4 — THE FIRST THUNDER:** Read `04 - The First Thunder.md` (currently ~7,600 words). November POV. CRITICAL CHAPTER — the blast, the separation from Horus. Needs aggressive cutting but preserve the concussive disorientation. Short sentences. Sensory chaos. Don't over-describe — the reader should feel lost alongside November. Cut any internal monologue that explains his emotions during the blast. He's in shock. Shock doesn't narrate itself. Target: 3,500-4,500 words. Overwrite.
- [x] **Edit Chapter 5 — THE PRAYER:** Read `05 - The Prayer.md` (currently ~6,300 words). Kael POV. Cut heavily. Kael's faith should be shown through ritual and certainty, not explained through theological narration. The prayer's silence should land once, clean. Don't tell the reader the silence "does not trouble him yet." Show him finishing the prayer, satisfied, and moving on. Target: 3,000-4,000 words. Overwrite.

---

## Phase 2 — Day 2 Chapters (First Blood)

- [ ] **Edit Chapter 6 — THE WAVE:** Read `06 - The Wave.md` (currently ~4,400 words). Stoneveil POV. Relatively close to target. Tighten the battle command sequences. Stoneveil's voice: clipped, tactical, no wasted words. Casualty reports should be numbers, not narration. Target: 3,000-3,500 words. Overwrite.
- [ ] **Edit Chapter 7 — THE BORROWED SWORD:** Read `07 - The Borrowed Sword.md` (currently ~8,600 words). November POV. KEY CHAPTER — first kill, Edric's introduction. Needs heavy cutting but preserve: the clumsy kill, the shaking hands, the ugly reality. Cut any combat description that makes November look competent. Edric's introduction should be quick and real — a name, a face, a moment. They bond through shared survival, not exposition. Target: 4,000-5,000 words. Overwrite.
- [ ] **Edit Chapter 8 — THE BONES SPEAK:** Read `08 - The Bones Speak.md` (currently ~6,200 words). Thokk POV. Death rites scene is key — preserve the ritual, the grief, the weight. Cut explanatory passages about orc culture. The reader learns by watching Thokk do the rites, not by being told what the rites mean. Target: 3,000-4,000 words. Overwrite.
- [ ] **Edit Chapter 9 — THE FIRST RITES:** Read `09 - The First Rites.md` (currently ~6,400 words). Kael POV. Cut the theological internal monologue. The prayer that doesn't save the dying soldier — show it. The silence after — show it. Don't explain the faith crack. Let the reader feel the ground shift. Target: 3,000-4,000 words. Overwrite.

---

## Phase 3 — Day 3 Chapters (The Grind)

- [ ] **Edit Chapter 10 — THE MATHEMATICS OF BLOOD:** Read `10 - The Mathematics of Blood.md` (currently ~6,400 words). Stoneveil POV. The triage decisions should be cold, quick, military. Cut narration between decisions. Let the choices stack up like body counts. Stoneveil eating standing up, sword in hand — that image is worth more than a page of internal reflection. Target: 3,000-4,000 words. Overwrite.
- [ ] **Edit Chapter 11 — THE COMPASS:** Read `11 - The Compass.md` (currently ~5,500 words). November POV. The inner compass check-in should be brief and real. November being useful (carrying water, dragging wounded, standing extra shifts) — show it in quick scenes, not extended narration. Deepen Edric bond through dialogue, not description. Target: 3,000-3,500 words. Overwrite.
- [ ] **Edit Chapter 12 — THE PRICE OF FEEDING:** Read `12 - The Price of Feeding.md` (currently ~4,300 words). Thokk POV. Close to target. Tighten the war-council dialogue. Skrixx should be chaotic and sharp in few words. Thokk recognizing the defenders' desperation as his own — one moment, clean. Don't belabor the mirror theme. Target: 3,000-3,500 words. Overwrite.
- [ ] **Edit Chapter 13 — THE SILENCE:** Read `13 - The Silence.md` (currently ~6,400 words). Kael POV. Marrow sentencing the deserter should be brutal and quick. Kael's recoil — shown through physical response, not theological argument. The prayer at the Cathedral: let the silence be silence. Don't describe it. Target: 3,000-4,000 words. Overwrite.

---

## Phase 4 — Day 4 Chapters (The Break)

- [ ] **Edit Chapter 14 — THE OUTER RING FALLS:** Read `14 - The Outer Ring Falls.md` (currently ~6,000 words). Stoneveil POV. The retreat order should land like a hammer. Cut to the decision, the order, the silence after. "Leaves wounded behind. Does not look back." — if the draft dilutes that with reflection, cut the reflection. Target: 3,000-4,000 words. Overwrite.
- [ ] **Edit Chapter 15 — THE RETREAT:** Read `15 - The Retreat.md` (currently ~7,600 words). November POV. KEY CHAPTER — carrying the wounded man. Edric helping. The Creed in action. Cut everything that isn't the weight of the man, the pace of the retreat, the decision to not leave him. Dialogue between November and Edric should be short, breathless, real. Target: 4,000-5,000 words. Overwrite.
- [ ] **Edit Chapter 16 — INSIDE THE WALLS:** Read `16 - Inside the Walls.md` (currently ~3,900 words). Thokk POV. Close to target. Thokk in the conquered district — the weight should be in what he sees, not what he thinks about what he sees. Respecting Stoneveil: one moment, clean. Target: 3,000-3,500 words. Overwrite.
- [ ] **Edit Chapter 17 — THE CRACKING:** Read `17 - The Cracking.md` (currently ~7,500 words). Kael POV. Heavy cut needed. The refugee scene should hit through specifics — one child, one woman's question — not through volume. Kael seeing Edric: brief, agonizing, one paragraph. Target: 3,500-4,500 words. Overwrite.

---

## Phase 5 — Day 5 Chapters (The Anvil)

- [ ] **Edit Chapter 18 — THE GHOST DISTRICT:** Read `18 - The Ghost District.md` (currently ~8,300 words). Stoneveil POV. KEY MOMENT — Blackhand's forge. Nearly double target. The forge scene should be devastating in its silence. Cut any narration that tells the reader this is ironic or horrifying. Stoneveil standing there, recognizing the spot, saying nothing — that's the scene. Don't explain it. Target: 3,500-4,500 words. Overwrite.
- [ ] **Edit Chapter 19 — STREET BY STREET:** Read `19 - Street by Street.md` (currently ~8,400 words). November POV. KEY MOMENT — the dilemma. The decision to go to the civilians should be shown through action, not internal debate. November doesn't agonize — he checks the compass, the compass points to the defenseless, he goes. Make it fast. The cost reveals itself after. Target: 4,000-5,000 words. Overwrite.
- [ ] **Edit Chapter 20 — THE SPIRITS GROW QUIET:** Read `20 - The Spirits Grow Quiet.md` (currently ~8,500 words). Thokk POV. Heavy cut needed. Street fighting: short, brutal. Grimtusk's news about silent spirits — delivered in one exchange, not a scene. Thokk pushes forward because backward doesn't exist. That's the whole chapter. Target: 3,500-4,000 words. Overwrite.
- [ ] **Edit Chapter 21 — THE BREAKING POINT:** Read `21 - The Breaking Point.md` (currently ~8,500 words). Kael POV. KEY MOMENT — the dying child. This must be the quietest, most devastating scene in the book. Cut everything around it. The prayer. The silence. The child. That's it. Less is more. If this scene has more than 500 words of the actual healing attempt, it's too many. Target: 3,500-4,500 words. Overwrite.

---

## Phase 6 — Day 6 Chapters (The Seventh Strike)

- [ ] **Edit Chapter 22 — THE LAST WALL:** Read `22 - The Last Wall.md` (currently ~3,700 words). Stoneveil POV. Close to target. Tighten the address to survivors. Not a speech — a fact. "We hold here or we die." Cut everything around that line that dilutes it. Target: 2,500-3,500 words. Overwrite.
- [ ] **Edit Chapter 23 — THE MAN WHO WOULD NOT LEAVE:** Read `23 - The Man Who Would Not Leave.md` (currently ~10,200 words). November POV. THE MOST IMPORTANT CHAPTER. Edric dies here. Cut to 5,000-6,000 words but preserve: the getting-back-up cycle, the magnetic refusal, Edric's death, November holding him. The death must be earned — if the draft has spent enough time building Edric across prior chapters, it only needs a few lines here to break the reader. Cut any combat that doesn't serve character. Target: 5,000-6,000 words. Overwrite.
- [ ] **Edit Chapter 24 — THE GATE:** Read `24 - The Gate.md` (currently ~7,500 words). Thokk POV. His last chapter alive. The momentum of the final push. Thokk at the front. Cut to the essential forward motion — a leader looking for the end. Target: 3,000-4,000 words. Overwrite.
- [ ] **Edit Chapter 25 — THE SEVENTH STRIKE:** Read `25 - The Seventh Strike.md` (currently ~8,600 words). Stoneveil POV. KEY MOMENT — the duel. Seven strikes. Not elegant. Two exhausted men. Cut any combat choreography that reads like fantasy dueling — this should be ugly, desperate, final. Thokk dies standing. Skrixx escapes. Target: 4,000-5,000 words. Overwrite.
- [ ] **Edit Chapter 26 — THE SILENCE AFTER:** Read `26 - The Silence After.md` (currently ~7,800 words). November POV. KEY MOMENT — searching for Horus. The emptiness. This should be the quietest chapter in the book. November walking through rubble. Looking. Not finding. Cut everything that isn't the search and the absence. Target: 3,000-4,000 words. Overwrite.

---

## Phase 7 — Epilogue

- [ ] **Edit Chapter 27 — THE CONSCRIPTION:** Read `27 - The Conscription.md` (currently ~9,300 words). November POV. Massively over target. Cut by 60%+. The conscription scene: an officer, an order, armor, an oath. November's motivation: the machine gives him reach to find Horus. That's it. No extended processing scenes. No lengthy reflection. He's November — he processes fast and moves forward. Target: 3,000-4,000 words. Overwrite.
- [ ] **Edit Chapter 28 — THE SKULL:** Read `28 - The Skull.md` (currently ~4,800 words). Stoneveil POV. Final chapter. Should be the shortest in the book. Stoneveil alone. Silence. Wind through ruins. Was it worth it? He doesn't answer. The book ends. Cut to bone. Target: 2,000-2,500 words. Overwrite.

---

## Phase 8 — Final Verification

- [ ] **Word count check:** Run word count on all chapters. Total should be 90,000-110,000. Log results in progress_edit.txt. If over 110k, identify the longest chapters and flag for additional cuts.
- [ ] **Continuity re-check:** Read all edited chapters in order. Verify: wounds still carry forward, Edric's arc still builds, foreshadowing seeds survive, key moments all land. Log any issues in progress_edit.txt.
- [ ] **Final commit:** Stage all edited chapters. Commit: `feat: complete edit pass — The Seventh Strike prose overhaul`. Do NOT push.
